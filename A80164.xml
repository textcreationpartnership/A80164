            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:118929:3"/> therefore away all <hi>wrath, prejudice,</hi> or <hi>bitterneſs,</hi> as in the following ſheets I have endeavoured to ſhew you your miſtakes, as to the matter of your Book, ſo I ſhall in this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> do the like, as to what is contained in your Epiſtle: In the mean time profeſſing my ſelf (to uſe your own expreſſion) <hi>bound for peace, as far as the ſhoes of the Goſpel will carry me;</hi> and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that diſpenſation (if it may be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this life) when all the Lords People ſhall be bleſſed with <hi>One heart,</hi> and guided <hi>into one way,</hi> only deſiring to divide my <hi>zeal</hi> equally betwixt <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> knowing that God is as much the God of the one, as of the other.</p>
            <p>I rejoyce to ſee my <hi>dear and Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> ſenſible of the great abuſe of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, for which they plead. I know our Brethren have not been ſuch <hi>Strangers in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> but they have ſeen and obſerved, that moſt of thoſe ſpurious notions, which in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heſe times of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> have been found in every Street, and with an impudent fore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>head have called the holy <hi>Spirit of God Father,</hi> and the lovely Virgin <hi>Truth</hi> mother, have been found lying at the door of this <hi>Liberty,</hi> and have really been born in her houſe. That moſt of thoſe ſad <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> which have rent the bowels of the Church, and overturned ſome Churches of God, both in <hi>Holland,</hi> and in <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New England,</hi> have been cauſed by
<pb facs="tcp:118929:3"/> the <hi>wind of this Liberty,</hi> which they ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep up. I know they cannot but have heard the cryes of many poor people in this County, who are fed with theſe <hi>husks</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>bread,</hi> with the <hi>chaff</hi> of theſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, inſtead of the more ſubſtantial wheat of publick Ordinances. And ſurely, if an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the <hi>blaſtings of Providence,</hi> or the general <hi>diſreliſh</hi> of judicious Chriſtians, be worth any thing, we have as good a <hi>plea</hi> as againſt any licentious practice in the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid once by a Learned Perſon in this Nation, that if a Book were compoſed of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sermons, preached by men of worth, containing the choiceſt matter contained in them, which had been Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within ſome few years, he believed no Book in the world would be to be compared with it: I believe our Brethren judge, that if all the <hi>Errors, Crudities, Nonſenſe, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, blaſphemies, ſelf-contradictions,</hi> which (by vertue of the exerciſe of this Liberty they plead for) have within theſe fifteen or ſixteen years laſt paſt, been vented in open Pulpits, were ſummed in one Book, the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Alcoran</hi> would ſcarce afford ſuch a <hi>rapſody</hi> of <hi>error, nonſenſe, blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>impertinency.</hi> To give our Brethren a taſte, I have a Letter ſtill by me, wrote by a gifted Brother, who took upon him to tell me, that he heard me
<pb facs="tcp:118929:4"/> ſuch a day, and I did not open my Text a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right (my Text that day was, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.— <hi>Aliens to the commonwealth of Iſrael.</hi>) He told me, if I had rightly opened it, I muſt have told my people, 1. <hi>What the wealth of Iſrael was.</hi> 2. <hi>How it came to be common.</hi> 3. <hi>How far forth it was common.</hi> With much more ſuch non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſical ſtuff; and very teachy he was with me, that I had not fallen upon his notions: if either this perſon had underſtood the Greek, or our Tranſlation had Tranſlated <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>polity,</hi> all the jeſt had been ſpoiled, which probably he would have made three Sermons upon.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have really thanked our Brethren, for acknowledging an abuſe of this Liberty, if I could have ſeen, 1. <hi>That any uſe of it</hi> (other than I had granted them) were not an abuſe of the greateſt Ordinance of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or if I could have ſeen that our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren could have fixed a <hi>rule of regulation,</hi> it would have done ſomething with me; but when you tell us, <hi>you plead for none but ſuch as are really gifted,</hi> and then tell us none have to do to judge <hi>whether they be ſo or no,</hi> it is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient the Church ſhould,</hi> but if they Preach <hi>without, it is no ſin.</hi> To my apprehenſion yee do but complain of a <hi>Flood-gate,</hi> that ſtands ope too deep, when your ſelves put in a bar that it may not ſhut down more cloſe. It is true, the abuſe of a thing plainly <hi>neceſſary</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:118929:4"/> by a <hi>neceſſity of precept,</hi> is no argument to take away the uſe, but where no precept is plain, the general miſcarriage, and accurſed conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, are a ſtrong <hi>topick</hi> to prove it is not according to the will of God. And I hope our Brethren upon ſecond thoughts, will not judge any one Text quoted by them plainly concluding the Caſe. All your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments run either from the uſe of <hi>gifts,</hi> to the uſe of <hi>this gift</hi> (when as yet you will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all gifts to be ſo exerciſed) nor any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made of the gift) or from <hi>examples</hi> where there is no <hi>parity,</hi> as you will perceive by the following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>You rightly apprehend, that the ſingular notion you have entertained of a Church is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of this, and many other unhappy Controverſies; you are therefore pleaſed in your Epiſtle, to endeavour to make the <hi>light</hi> of your notion concerning a Church to reflect upon our faces. You tell us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a Church is a particular company of Saints in mutual union for mutual Fellowſhip in the means of worſhip appointed by Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. Dedic.</note> 
               <hi>for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the edification of their own ſouls, and the good of others.</hi> This you ſay is the only Church that is capable of Officers to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſet in it, and over it.</p>
            <p>That this is a Church we grant, but that only this Church is capable of Officers we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: I ſhall have liberty to enter my diſſent,
<pb facs="tcp:118929:5"/> in examining the ſix particulars you inſtance in for the explication of this deſcription.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You ſay <hi>it is a company,</hi> that we grant, <hi>Eccleſia</hi> properly is <hi>nomen multitudinis,</hi> one properly and ſtrictly cannot be called a Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>You ſay it is a particular Company,</hi> and that <hi>there never was, nor ever will be exiſting in rerum naturâ, any other than a particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi> I muſt confeſs to my <hi>dear Brethren,</hi> that I cannot fathom their notion of <hi>particular:</hi> we uſe to ſay, <hi>particularis</hi> is oppoſed both to <hi>univerſalis</hi> and <hi>ſingularis,</hi> I ſuppoſe our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren here oppoſe it to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis.</hi> An <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal theme</hi> in Logick is that (as our Brethren know) which is apt to be predicated natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concerning many: I think <hi>Church</hi> is ſuch a Theme. Thus much our Brethren I am ſure will grant, that their Congregations at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Norwich, Yarmouth,</hi> may each of them be called a <hi>Church.</hi> Now the Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all theſe Churches may not be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and <hi>called a Church:</hi> Or if you will, <hi>Whether all the Churches of God upon the earth, may not by an univerſal notion be called a Church,</hi> or is not called a <hi>Church</hi> in Scripture. You acknowledge it in a <hi>reformed ſenſe</hi> an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal company,</hi> but not an <hi>univerſal Church,</hi> that is (as I ſuppoſe you mean) <hi>a body capable of Officers,</hi> otherwiſe it were a ſtrange thing that ſeven perſons, who are viſible Saints

All theſe Texts will prove, that the Scripture hath not reſtrained the notion of Church to a <hi>particular Company</hi> ſo called.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>This is a Church not capable of Officers to be ſet in or over it. Brethren,</hi> have you read what Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> ſaith, to prove Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Officers to the Church Catholick? Do they not (when they <hi>Baptize</hi>) admit into the Catholick Church;<note place="margin">Pag. 232:</note> why elſe are not your Members baptized again, when they are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from the particular Church into which (according to this principle) alone they were Baptized? Do they not by <hi>Excommunication</hi> caſt out of the <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> Or will our <hi>Brethren</hi> ſay, that a Church may lawfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to its Communion, a Member which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church hath cut off from her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Were the Apoſtles (think our Brethren) <hi>Officers</hi> only to a particular Church? If to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> then there was an <hi>univerſal Church</hi> once exiſting, capable of Officers. Nor is that irrefragable Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. (as our
<pb facs="tcp:118929:6"/> Brethren ſay) <hi>preſt to the ſervice of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</hi> No, it comes as the Lords <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> willing to engage for this Truth. You ſay <hi>Brethren,</hi> that what it is written, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. of that chapter, <hi>God hath ſet the Members every one in the body,</hi> doth <hi>as much prove a Catholick or univerſal Body,</hi> as God <hi>hath ſet ſome in the Church, proves a Catholick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</hi> I know my Brethren aym at greater things than quiblings about a word: that paſſage <hi>God hath ſet the Members every one in the body,</hi> together with <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>and all the members of that one body, being many are one body,</hi> will prove that the body is <hi>Totum integrale:</hi> So alſo ſaith the Apoſtle is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> i. e. the Church of Chriſt. If our Brethren will but grant us this, That the Church is a <hi>Totum integrale,</hi> you muſt grant that a particular Church is but a part of this <hi>Totum.</hi> If you ſay there is no other <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> called a <hi>Church,</hi> but only the particular Church, I have proved the contrary, that the term of Church is applied otherwiſe than to a particular Church. If you ſay, this <hi>Church hath no Officers,</hi> that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. confutes you; neither will your conſequence follow, that becauſe an <hi>univerſal body</hi> is not proved from <hi>ver.</hi> 18. therefore an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> is not proved from <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>viz.</hi> from the whole verſe. If it had been ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 18. God hath ſet the members every one in the body; and then the Text had made an enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration
<pb facs="tcp:118929:6"/> of ſuch members, ſome of whoſe uſe and office was not confined to the ſervice of that particular body, but would ſerve any other particular bodies, as he doth of Church Officers, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. I hope it would have proved an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal body.</hi> You tell us (Brethren) you renounce <hi>the name and thing of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> or <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> you muſt then renounce the Holy Scripture (witneſs the Texts before mentioned) and renounce right reaſon, and renounce the moſt learned and judicious of your own Brethren, who generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, both the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>thing,</hi> only deny it to be <hi>Organical:</hi> But you think, you have five Arguments will prove, that a particular Church cannot be a part, but a <hi>Totum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. You ſay firſt, <hi>every part is in power incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; But every particular Church hath the power of a whole Church</hi>—And <hi>may act in all Church work, not as a part, but as a whole.</hi> I muſt deny your Minor (Brethren!) I hope you account a power to meet in a Synod, and to conſult (at leaſt) a piece of Church work, to which Gods word gives a power, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and yet when you think of it again, you will not ſay that a particular Church hath a power alone to <hi>make a Synod.</hi> We ſay the like for Ordination (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in caſes of abſolute neceſſity) and for <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi> (where the Church is very ſmall) there are that think it is not a work fit for a particular Church. See Brethren what
<pb facs="tcp:118929:7"/> 
               <hi>Reverend</hi> Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> ſays to all theſe in the Book before cited.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You tell us next, that <hi>every whole</hi> is <hi>really diſtinct from every part, and from all its parts collectively conſidered, they are conſtituting, that is conſtituted; but where that Church is which is really diſtinct from all particular Churches, or wherefore it is you know not.</hi> This is Brethren ſuch a fallacy, as ſcarce deſerveth an anſwer; the body of a man is <hi>a whole,</hi> all his <hi>members are parts;</hi> now when you have found out where that body is, which is really diſtinct from all the members, and wherefore it is, you will have anſwered your ſelves. The Nation of <hi>England</hi> is a <hi>whole,</hi> every Pariſh is a part, finde us where that Nation is, which is diſtinct really from all the Pariſhes taken together. We uſe to make this a Maxime in Logick,<note place="margin">Totum reipſâ non differt à partibus ſuis ſimul ſumptis &amp; unitis.</note> 
               <hi>That a whole doth not really differ from all its parts ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together and united.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In the next place you tell us, there can be no <hi>viſible univerſal Church, becauſe there is no univerſal viſible meeting:</hi> and that <hi>the Greek word tranſlated Church (in all Civil and Sacred uſage) ſignifies a meeting,</hi> in <hi>fieri</hi> or <hi>facto eſse.</hi> But you began to think that the <hi>inviſible Church, are never like to have ſuch a meeting;</hi> and therefore (to ſalve it) you heal this <hi>wound</hi> in your Argument (in my opinion) <hi>very ſlightly,</hi> when you ſay, <hi>it doth meet inviſibly &amp; in Spirit.</hi> If you will but grant us that <hi>Brethren,</hi> that the
<pb facs="tcp:118929:7"/> name of Church in Scripture, is given to thoſe that never <hi>locally meet,</hi> but it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for them to be preſent <hi>in Spirit;</hi> you have by an unhappy heel, kicked down all that <hi>good milk,</hi> which your Argument was <hi>giving down</hi> for the ſuckling of your <hi>infant-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a Church. And yet the Scripture will enforce you to grant it, it ſpeaks <hi>of the Church of the firſt-born.</hi> There is an univerſal meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Catholick viſible Church,</hi> at the throne of Grace (before their great Paſtor) and <hi>in Spirit</hi> (as it is only poſſible for a Catholick Church to meet) whiles they agree in the Profeſſion of the ſame Truths and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For <hi>the viſible Meeting</hi> which you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned at firſt, you have quitted your plea for the <hi>viſibility,</hi> to ſave the <hi>Church of the firſt-born</hi> from Excommunication; and we hope it will alſo ſave the Church Catholick, viſible, from any hurt by this Argument.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You go on <hi>(Brethren)</hi> and tell us, <hi>There are no diſtinct Officers for a Catholick Viſible Church:</hi> Ergo, <hi>there is no ſuch Church.</hi> If you had expreſſed the Major Propoſition, I ſhould have denied it; the aſſertion of a <hi>Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick viſible</hi> (though we add <hi>Organical</hi>) doth not imply there muſt be <hi>diſtinct Officers</hi> for that Church; it is enough that the Officers of the ſeveral particular Churches (which as parts conſtitute that whole) have power to act as Officers in any of thoſe parts, which
<pb facs="tcp:118929:8"/> united make up that whole: I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but here neceſſity conſtrains me to tell my <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> that this is no fair play, to pretend to diſpute againſt the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an notion of a Catholick Church, and to mention only the <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and <hi>Prelatical Notion of it.</hi> Let any one read Mr. <hi>Hudſons Vindication,</hi> p. 129, 130, 131. and he will ſee we plead not for ſuch an univerſal Church, as muſt needs have a Pope for an univerſal Head, and Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. for his derivatives. But this we ſay, that the whole Church (all the particular Churches in the world) make but <hi>one body of Chriſt;</hi> and as it is one <hi>(una)</hi> ſo it is <hi>(unita)</hi> united in a Common Profeſſion of the Goſpel; &amp; as there is this union, and communion of members, ſo there is a communion of ſome Officers, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Miniſters, who may Preach as Chriſts Ambaſſadors, by vertue of Office, any where, and may any where Baptize, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Lords Supper, upon occaſion; and we ſay our Brethren in practice grant this; for the Paſtor of one of their Churches will give the <hi>Supper of the Lord</hi> to thoſe, to whom he is not in Office, as his particular Church, and this is a Common practice with our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; how conſiſtent with our Brethrens principle let them judge: while our Brethren ſay they do this by vertue of a Communion of Churches, they do but blinde the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:118929:8"/> People with a dark notion, that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing: What mean they by a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Churches, if they do not mean this, that by the word of God, one particular Church hath a power to communicate in that Ordinance with another? If they have ſo, there muſt be a Communion of Offices, as well as Gifts, for the diſpenſing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments is acknowledged by our Brethren to be an act of Office. If that it be not the will of God in his Word, that the Officer of one Church, ſhould do an act of Office in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church, or to a Member of another Church, it is not his will that in all things there ſhould be a communion of Churches. If this be his will, it is as much as we ask; for then the Officer is not only an Officer to the particular Church, and the members of it, but alſo to any particular Churches in the world, or to any of their Members. We ask no more. This is the Catholick Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church we plead for. Let our Brethren conſider whether while they think this an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol, and pretend to abhor it, in the notion, they do not in practice bow down to it, and <hi>commit Sacrilege.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. You tell us in the laſt place (Brethren) <hi>That no Church is greater than that Church which hath power to determine, and hear offences,</hi> Mat. 18.17. <hi>But that is a particular Church. Ergo.</hi> You are ſenſible that your Minor is not <hi>extra
<pb facs="tcp:118929:9"/> aleam controverſiae,</hi> and you have taken as good care as you could, to ſtrengthen it, by ſaying, <hi>it cannot be meant of both; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Congregational Church, is unſcriptural, irrational, abſurd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt crave leave to tell you, 1. <hi>That your whole Argument</hi> is nothing to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it is not, <hi>whether be greater the Church Catholik,</hi> or <hi>the Church particular;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any <hi>Church Catholick</hi> or no, <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, if there be any it muſt be greater.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then I muſt examine your ſenſe of the word <hi>Greater,</hi> whether you underſtand it in reſpect of <hi>quantity</hi> or <hi>quality:</hi> If in reſpect of <hi>quantity, number, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> is apparently falſe. If in reſpect of <hi>quality,</hi> as you ſeem to hint by the term, <hi>having power,</hi> then your Argument is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no Church hath a greater power, than that which hath the power to hear and determine offences committed in the Churches:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the particular Church hath that power,</hi> Mat. 18.17. Ergo.</p>
            <p>I will give you Brethren ſuch another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, judge you whether it be good or no, and if it be not, you muſt prove your own better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no Court hath a greater power than that which hath the power to hear and determine offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118929:9"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Sheriffs-Hundred-Court hath a power to determine offences.</hi> Ergo, that is as great a Court as the Court of <hi>Common. Pleas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt therefore put in <hi>finally</hi> determine, and <hi>all offences,</hi> in any part of the Church, or elſe your <hi>Major</hi> is falſe, when you have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that we will deny your <hi>Minor,</hi> and tell you, that admit that Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. ſhould be meant of a particular Church, yet it proves no ſuch power, either <hi>finally</hi> to determine, or all <hi>offences,</hi> as well thoſe betwixt <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> as thoſe betwixt <hi>party</hi> and <hi>party,</hi> or <hi>party</hi> and <hi>Church.</hi> Neither can I divine the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity you would impoſe upon us of exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the one or the other Church out of that Text, (according to the nature of the offence) nor do I think your ſaying, that to exclude the <hi>Congregational Church,</hi> viz. ſome Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Churches, is <hi>unſcriptural, irrational, abſurd,</hi> amounts ſo much as to the ninety ninth part of an Argument in the caſe. I think it is far more <hi>rational,</hi> and <hi>far leſs abſurd,</hi> to ſay that when a Member is to be cut off from all the Churches of God in the earth, it ſhould be done by a <hi>Church,</hi> made up of ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in aſſociation and upon a Common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, and by a common act of many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and Judicious perſons, then by <hi>ſeven perſons,</hi> none of which poſſibly hath reaſon enough to judge truly of the merit of the cauſe. And in reaſon it ſhould ſeem more like
<pb facs="tcp:118929:10"/> to be the will of Chriſt, who is very tender of all his peoples ſouls. Our <hi>Brethren</hi> know we could give them ſad inſtances of particular Churches, excommunicating their Godly and Reverend Paſtors, who are ſufficiently known to have deſerved no ſuch things.</p>
            <p>You tell us Brethren, that the Officers of Churches met together, are no true Church. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> (you ſay) ſaid ſome ſuch thing, but it was in a caſe no more like this, than <hi>chalk</hi> is like <hi>cheeſe:</hi> We are diſputing now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Officers of particular Churches meeting together in a Synod, may not be called a Church, they being ſent to repreſent the particular Churches.</hi> We have a Rule in Logick, <hi>Cui competit definitio convenit definitum.</hi> I therefore argue.</p>
            <p>A Church ſay you, <hi>Is a particular Company of Saints in mutual union, for mutual fellowſhip in the means of Worſhip appointed by Chriſt, for the glory of God, the edification of their own ſouls, and the good of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a juſtly-conſtituted Synod is ſuch a Company—<hi>Ergo,</hi> they are a <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are a Company,</hi> one cannot make a Synod.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They are a particular Company,</hi> they are but a part of the Church, not every individual; nor (ſay our Brethren) did ever any other company exiſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are an <hi>holy Company,</hi> at leaſt ſhould, or may be ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:118929:10"/>4. They are <hi>united,</hi> their conſent to meet and ſit together unites them, ſo doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the particular Churches ſending them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are united unto fellowſhip in <hi>means of Worſhip,</hi> we will ſuppoſe them while they are together, to meet together in one place on the Lords days to hear, pray, receive Sacraments together, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The end of this fellowſhip, is the glory of God, the edification of themſelves, and the whole Church, and the good of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in Anſwer to our Brethrens expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion borrowed from <hi>Zuinglius</hi> in a quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſe, <hi>Repreſentativant eſſe credo, veram non credo.</hi> I return, <hi>Aut veram eſſe credo, aut falſam eſſe veſtram credo definitionem:</hi> Either they are a true Church, or your definition of a Church is not true.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you tell us, a Church muſt be <hi>an holy Company.</hi> I Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. So was not the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 19.32, 42. But concerning the Church of Chriſt, we grant it <hi>(ſano ſenſu)</hi> upon ſome of your Arguments, which I think are conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive enough.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſay, God himſelf calleth the whole <hi>Jewiſh Nation holy,</hi> Exod. 19.6. The Apoſtle calls the <hi>ſeed</hi> of thoſe Parents <hi>holy,</hi> where one of them was a believer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. In this ſenſe we grant every member of the Church muſt be holy, ſeparated from a Paganiſh converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:118929:11"/> and under an external Covenant with God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſay, it is their duty to be holy by <hi>ſanctification,</hi> this they are to labour after. But we deny,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That they muſt neceſſarily be all real Saints, or no Church,</hi> and this our Brethren will not own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That a <hi>viſibility of ſaving grace,</hi> is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the conſtitution of a Church in <hi>all the members of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe our Brethren (we hope) will own the Infants of their members, to be <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> in whom is no ſuch viſibility.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe ſpecial ſaving grace is a <hi>thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,</hi> and of which we can make no true judgement.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe we find <hi>no ground in Scripture for it;</hi> we cannot ſee what viſibility of ſaving grace the Apoſtles could act by, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted three thouſand and five thouſand in a day, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. more then their being baptized upon their owning the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, our <hi>Brethren</hi> themſelves ſay, <hi>that filthy matter may be found in a Church conſtituted, which is not fit matter in the conſtitution:</hi> We look upon the Companies of perſons in our Pariſhes, as they have united themſelves in means of worſhip, <hi>Churches conſtituted, not to be conſtituted;</hi> and do not underſtand (while
<pb facs="tcp:118929:11"/> the form, which doth <hi>dare eſſe</hi> continues) how ſome decays in the matter annihilates the Church, any more then the rottenneſs of ſome pieces of Timber, yea though the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of thoſe pieces be hardly ſound, makes the houſe (while it ſtands and keeps the form) not to be an houſe.</p>
            <p>But fifthly, we grant to our Brethren, that ſuch as err in the <hi>fundamentals</hi> of the Goſpel, or are <hi>affectedly ignorant of them,</hi> or are <hi>guilty of leudneſs in their lives,</hi> ought to be <hi>caſt out of the Church,</hi> though we dare not determine any ſingle acts of wickedneſs <hi>inconſiſtent with grace,</hi> remembring the failings of <hi>Lot, Noah, David, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> yet we ſay by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Command of God (though they may have a root of grace) they ought to be admoniſhed, ſuſpended, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and this for the glory of God, the honour of the Church, and the good of their own ſouls, not becauſe they have no ſaving grace, or no <hi>viſibility of it;</hi> for it may be we may have ſeen formerly ſo much of them, as to make us of another minde.</p>
            <p>We therefore grant you <hi>(brethren)</hi> that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, is the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>body of Chriſt,</hi> and yet there may be ſubjects of this Kingdom, who give not due homage to him, <hi>members of this body, real members,</hi> and yet <hi>muſt be cut off,</hi> branches in <hi>this Vine,</hi> and yet not <hi>bringing forth fruit,</hi> John 15.2.
<pb facs="tcp:118929:12"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>You deſire to know</hi> what reaſon we have to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a practice of enquiring after a truth of Grace, in order to the Communion in the Lords Supper, and yet to blame you for ſuch an enquiry in order to the Communion of Saints.</q> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Brethren is very eaſie, <hi>Becauſe we find, that a man ſhould examine himſelf before he eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of that Bread and drinks of that Cup:</hi> but we no where find, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, before he comes into the fellowſhip of the Church;</hi> and we think the three thouſand and five thouſand had ſcarce any leiſure before their admiſſion, to do it very throughly. But our Brethren know no Rule they ſay, for an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of compleat and owned Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body from the Sacrament. If you conſult <hi>Beza</hi>'s notes upon 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. He will ſhew you plain Scripture for it; if the <hi>inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon</hi> had been excommunicated, St. <hi>Paul</hi> needed not to have ſaid, <hi>ſufficient is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is inflicted,</hi> for they had puniſhed him as much as they could. Nor was there any <hi>thing to be remitted.</hi> See <hi>Beza</hi> on the Text more fully. However our Brethren (as I hear) ordinarily practiſe it, when a perſon is under <hi>admonition,</hi> and the Church waiting to ſee the iſſue of it, we plead for it no further.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You tell us fifthly (Brethren) that a Church muſt be an <hi>united company;</hi> if you had told us <hi>in what ſenſe</hi> you underſtand <hi>united,</hi> we could better have told you our minds (at
<pb facs="tcp:118929:12"/> leaſt I could have better told you mine) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. People may be united by <hi>cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by <hi>common profeſſion,</hi> by mutual <hi>conſent,</hi> this you ſeem to underſtand: this again may be either <hi>explicitly,</hi> by <hi>Covenant,</hi> or <hi>implicitly,</hi> by a conſtant joyning in the ſame practice which our Brethren contend for, or whether they be indifferent in the thing I cannot tell: this being premiſed Brethren, I conceive.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every company called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cannot be ſaid to be an united company, either as to an <hi>union</hi> of <hi>judgement</hi> or practice: the rout, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. called by this name were not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Every Religious Company or Church of Chriſt</hi> (called by this name in Scripture) <hi>were united,</hi> but neither by <hi>cohabitation,</hi> nor yet by <hi>conſent to walk together in the ſame individual Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> but every ſuch company muſt be an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>company</hi> as to profeſſion of the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and acknowledging the ſame ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ordinances of the Goſpel; all the places I quoted out of Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> to prove the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church prove this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is no need that every particular Church</hi> (if not organized) and under the exerciſe of Diſcipline, <hi>ſhould be united, by conſent as to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in the ſame numerical Adminiſtrations;</hi> every particular company of the univerſal Church may properly enough be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> without <hi>ſuch a conſent;</hi> you often read of the <hi>Church</hi> in a particular houſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.15.
<pb facs="tcp:118929:13"/> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. of which no ſuch thing can be proved.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Indeed it ſeems reaſonable, that <hi>a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, organized, and in which Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ordinarily ſhould be adminiſtred, ſhould be a company united by conſent;</hi> for my own part I can allow you this, though I know ſome of my Brethren will not.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion muſt needs be by an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Covenant, or conſent is neither to be proved by one Text, nor yet by one ſound reaſon,</hi> and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this as neceſſary, is a meer humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and not to be indured, becauſe there is not the leaſt warrant in Gods word for it.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, we heartily wiſh, <hi>that for the putting of our Churches into order upon clear grounds for the exerciſe of power, the members of our Churches would ſubmit to ſuch an explicite conſent.</hi> And we cannot but commend our <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> Brethren for endeavouring to bring their people to it, though we ſuppoſe they will be tender of Excommunicating ſuch, as ſeeing no command of God for it, ſhall not think fit to ſubmit to it: Thus far I can yield our Brethren, that a particular Church is an <hi>united Company.</hi> And upon this principle we plead for our Parocheall Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be true Churches, not (as ſome would (ridiculouſly) faſten upon us) becauſe they live within ſuch local limits, but becauſe <hi>they
<pb facs="tcp:118929:13"/> are ſocieties of baptized perſons, who by a tacit, and implicit conſent, have united themſelves, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God in the ſame numerical Ordinances of inſtituted worſhip.</hi> And this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> holding, we ſay they are to be looked upon as <hi>true Churches,</hi> although (as the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>) corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome of their members, and therefore not to be ſeparated from, nor diſowned as no Churches, but to be purged, and the <hi>old lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> put out, that they may be a <hi>new lump.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. For what our Brethren ſay in the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ſixth</hi> place, <hi>That they muſt be a company united unto fellowſhip in means of worſhip appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, and this for the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. I freely grant, nay it may be I will grant more, <hi>viz.</hi> that they muſt be a people, who either have <hi>elected</hi> or <hi>ſubmitted</hi> to the Officers of the Church for the Adminiſtration of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>But let it not offend my <hi>dear and reverend Brethren,</hi> if I tell them, I have almoſt made my head ake, with ſtudying the connexion of a paſſage which you have in the laſt <hi>page</hi> of your Epiſtle (ſave one) and do what I can, I underſtand not how it relates to the former Diſcourſe, or is brought in upon any eaſier terms, then they ſay, The Fellow brought in <hi>Hercules,</hi> viz. by <hi>head and ſhoulders;</hi> for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly) if it had been led by the conduct of <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>reaſon,</hi> it would never have come there: The paſſage is this,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118929:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But we ſhall ſay no more of this, Our Brethren not being baptized into the belief of the ſame truth, aſſerting Presbyterial Government to be from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, although the confidence of our late Aſſembly could ſay no more but this: The Scripture doth hold forth, that many particular Congregations may be under one Presbyterial Government. May be! they would have ſaid, muſt be, had they ſeen the ſtamp of</hi> Jus Divinum <hi>upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt profeſs my ſelf (dear Brethren) to be ſo ignorant, that I can neither underſtand the ſenſe of this paſſage, either <hi>copulatively,</hi> or <hi>disjunctively;</hi> will you give me leave to ſift it a little? poſſibly (though it all looks like chaff) ſome kernels of <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>truth</hi> may be found in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But we ſhall ſay no more of this</hi> (you ſay) <hi>Our Brethren not being Baptized into the belief of the ſame Truth.</hi> Of this? of what? You had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been ſpeaking <hi>of the Papiſts, making their Decrees and humane inventions, equal with the ten Commandments;</hi> and told us, <hi>you believe Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of new matter are ceaſed, and that Chriſt hath ceaſed from his work,</hi> &amp;c. Now you tell us, you ſhall ſay no more of this: your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (viz. <hi>We of the Presbyterial perſwaſion) not being baptized into the belief of the ſame truth, aſſerting Presbyterial Government to be from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> whats this to the making of <hi>Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of equal authority with Gods word?</hi> Do any of us make them ſo? Or had our Brethren a
<pb facs="tcp:118929:14"/> minde to make the world believe that of us which never entred into our thoughts, nor was ever expreſſed by us in any of our Books. Doth <hi>[the ſame truth]</hi> relate only to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that we are not <hi>all of a minde,</hi> as to the <hi>Divine Right of Church-Government:</hi> what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Brethren have added this in this place, or what is the meaning of thoſe words? <hi>[But we ſhall ſay no more of this]</hi> and then adding the other <hi>as a reaſon.</hi> But let us ſee if there be more <hi>truth</hi> in what followeth, <hi>That the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians do not all believe that their Government came from Heaven:</hi> They are fouly to blame then, for I ſhould think <hi>Popery,</hi> as to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, better than <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> if I did not think Presbyterie came from heaven. But it is yet more wonderfull (Brethren!) which you tell us, that the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> did not ſo believe, yea, expreſſed as much; for they only ſay, <hi>Many particular Congregations may be united;</hi> and you note, they would have ſaid <hi>muſt be,</hi> if they had ſo judged. Our Brethren have indeed ſaid in their terms no more then it <hi>may be,</hi> but they have alſo in the ſame place proved that it was ſo, both in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and alſo in the <hi>Church of Epheſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they only ſay it <hi>may be,</hi> but prove it <hi>muſt be,</hi> I hope it is enough; our <hi>Reverend Brethren</hi> loved to uſe <hi>ſoft words,</hi> and <hi>hard Arguments:</hi> But indeed they could not well ſay it <hi>muſt be,</hi> for there might be but one <hi>particular Church in
<pb facs="tcp:118929:15"/> a Nation,</hi> and then it was not neceſſary; but ſurely our Brethren would not have ſaid, <hi>it may be,</hi> if they had thought there was no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or general ground for it <hi>in Gods word,</hi> and ſurely, what hath ſuch a foundation in <hi>Gods word,</hi> is <hi>jure Divino</hi> (not withſtanding our Brethrens critical obſervation.) Our <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Aſſembly do not ſay <hi>it may be,</hi> the ſenſe of the Texts they quote to prove it, yet you (Brethren) muſt remember you tell us ſo for ſome if not all of your Texts for <hi>Election,</hi> where all you pretend to, is our ſenſe <hi>may be the ſenſe;</hi> yet I hope you will ſay that <hi>Election</hi> is <hi>jure Divino.</hi> Our Brethren know that they have pretended a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> too for gifted mens preaching, and yet for fear of their ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maintenance (and to avoid our Argument from thence) tell us, <hi>they may preach</hi> occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, but will not ſay, <hi>They muſt</hi> preach conſtantly.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place <hi>Brethren,</hi> you fear we may be <hi>provoked</hi> againſt you, and therefore you favour us with your Reaſons, for engaging in this ſervice, and <hi>excuſe</hi> for coming into it ſo late. <q>A pit you ſay hath been digged, and a long time ſtood open, and divers have fallen into it, and you come out in charity to cover it.</q> Whether you have indeed <hi>covered, or uncovered a Pit,</hi> Let every judicious Chriſtian judge, yea let the experiences of all the Churches of Chriſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. I beſeech my <hi>dear and reverend Brethren</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:118929:15"/> to lay their hands upon their hearts, and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider whether they have not uncovered <hi>that pit,</hi> into which ſome years ſince, many (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) Brethren in <hi>New England</hi> falling, ſank, and roſe up no more to a viſible repentance for their Errors and Blaſphemies. <hi>That pit,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which many Members of our Brethrens Churches in <hi>Holland fell,</hi> &amp; that ſadly too. <hi>That pit</hi> into which many Members of their late <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> yea in <hi>Norfolk</hi> fell, and are come out <hi>Quakers, pleaders for the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> for the <hi>power of Miracles</hi> (as not ceaſed) <hi>conferring</hi> (as they pretend) the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c.

This pit our Brethren have endeavoured again to uncover, and I hope it will appear as vain an attempt as his who would needs rebuild <hi>Jericho</hi> (as to the iſſue of the work, though not as to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the perſons, whom I deſire to love &amp; honor, for their work ſake, though not for this <hi>works ſake</hi>) I could have heartily wiſhed, my Brethren had left this Idol to plead for it ſelf, and I dare ſay, they might have done it without offending, one humble, ſerious judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtian, (at leaſt who is known to me)</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118929:16"/>
            <p>I moſt humbly beſeech my dear and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brethren,</hi> to hear the cryes of many ſober judicious perſons, lamenting the ſad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pariſhes wherein they live, which inſtead of able and godly Miniſters, are ſerved with none, but ſuch as mend their trading on the week day, by aſſuming this unbridled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty on the Sabbath, who are both obtruded upon them, and unable to ſpeak the word of God as they ought to ſpeak; ſo that they are forced (in theſe days of Reformation too) to go from <hi>Pariſh</hi> to <hi>Pariſh,</hi> to ſeek one who can ſpeak to them <hi>in the name of the Lord,</hi> or to whoſe preaching they can go in faith, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon it <hi>as a publike Ordinance.</hi> Doth not this Liberty dead the hearts of ſober men, as to acting in any Reformation, by caſting out <hi>ſcandalous, ignorant, and inſufficient Miniſters?</hi> While they ſee little more good from it, then caſting out one <hi>ignorant inſufficient man,</hi> to make way for ſome others; or the caſting out one that would propheſie of <hi>wine and ſtrong drink,</hi> to make way for others, who ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie the vain imaginations of their own hearts, or the errors of <hi>Millenaries, Anti-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial perſons,</hi> and high flown <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> and who would not judge, that if people muſt be under this ſad deſtiny to have a <hi>ſnare for their ſouls ſtand in their Pulpits,</hi> it had better be one that every one knows, and would avoid, than one that is covered over with the hypocriſie
<pb facs="tcp:118929:16"/> of a little hay or ſtubble, and is no leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and more hard to be diſcovered by vulgar eyes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Brethren!</hi> I beg your pardon, if in this caſe, the zeal of my God, his Houſe, People, Truths glory, hath eaten me up, in this Cauſe in which I think all of them are ſo deeply concerned, and ſad experience hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it.</p>
            <p>As to your excuſe, for coming ſo late into this <hi>Diſ-ſervice</hi> to the Church and Truth of God, I have no reaſon to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it; as thinking you have at laſt come <hi>too ſoon:</hi> And I am apt to believe the Rebukes of your own Conſcience might retard your expedition: I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to follow you with more ſpeed, obſerving it a piece of Wiſdom of the GOD of Nature, to plant the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote within view of the Poiſon.

            <p>THere are three or four great Truths of God, the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telage</hi> of which, from their enemies (at leaſt in theſe parts) I have formerly undertaken, <hi>1. The Divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Goſpel Preaching,</hi> in the adminiſtration of which, all who thought themſelves <hi>gifted men</hi> pleaded a right of <hi>intercommonage</hi> with thoſe, who according to Goſpel-Rules are <hi>ſeparated</hi> to that work: <hi>2. The liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtians, from the obſervation of Holy Days. 3. The pure adminiſtration of the holy Sacrament of the Supper:</hi> and <hi>4. The Divine Right of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the hands of Chriſts proper Officers.</hi> My diſcourſe concerning the firſt, I have already once vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated; what I ſaid upon the ſecond (to my knowledge) none hath yet anſwered; as to the two laſt, there hath been ſomething publiſhed to the world, under pretence of anſwer. <hi>John Timſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> have pretended ſomething by way of anſwer to the third: and <hi>Theoph. Brabourne</hi> to the fourth. And now three Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have undertaken me the ſecond time, in the defence of the Preaching of <hi>gifted mens Preaching.</hi> I ſhall only give thee a true account, why I have ſaid nothing to the three other Anſwerers, nor have any thoughts to do it. As for <hi>John Timſon</hi> had he fallen upon me but with his <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whip,</hi> I think I ſhould have turnd again, but falling ſo fouly upon me with his <hi>plow-ſtaff</hi> (upon a maxime I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſome Gentlemen, that a Rapier is no weapon fit to engage a Carter upon the Road) I thought it prudence to
<pb facs="tcp:118929:18"/> runaway: Beſides that, perceiving he had got the Art to anſwer himſelf by more then one manifeſt contradiction; I thought it pity any one elſe ſhould be put to the trouble, especially conſidering, that after I had drawn ſeven or eight ſheets of an Anſwer, my Stationer aſſured me, he had not ſold above one of his Books, and it was pity by an Anſwer, to commend his Book to the worlds Enquiry Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi> indeed diſcovers a reverend opinion of his Book, I ſuppoſe for the <hi>Notion</hi> he in the main drives, not for his way of handling of it, which I think ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſuch a character. As for Mr. <hi>Humfry,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him ſailing in his last Book at a lower rate, and I was loth by an anſwer to ſerve him with a wind, which might have tempted him to have spread his ſails to their former wideneſs (I remember the ill influence, learned <hi>Spanhemius</hi> his Anſwer to <hi>Amiraldus</hi> had upon him to this purpoſe.) Beſides that, I ſaw I muſt have differed with him in more <hi>momentous matter</hi> then that of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, if I had given him a ſtrist anſwer: and I was not willing to raiſe more duſt of Controverſie then is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready raiſed in the world. As for <hi>Theoph. Brabourne,</hi> as I could finde nothing in his Book beſides <hi>error</hi> and <hi>non-ſenſe:</hi> ſo I perceive the world had no better opinion of it; the Stationer returning him his Printed Copies for <hi>New-years-gifts</hi> for his Friends, becauſe he could ſell none of them, or but exceeding few, and though I have often met the Books at my Friends Houſes, where he had given them, yet (that I know of) I never found any of them made fit to read, or otherwiſe uſed than to kindle Tobacco. Beſides that, immediatly after his publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Rapſody of impertinence, I ſaw ſome Papers he had ſcattered up and down this City, to prove there were three distinct Gods, and to the will of which of them he had calculated his Book I could not tell. <hi>The GOD whom I ſerve is but one,</hi> he that can <hi>blaſpheme</hi> the Living GOD, may be excuſed for that crime towards
<pb facs="tcp:118929:18"/> his Truths and Servants, and deſerves not to be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in a Chriſtians mouth.</p>
            <p>As for this laſt Book, called <hi>The Preacher Sent,</hi> I finde it written by <hi>grave and ſober perſons,</hi> with a good ſhew of Argument (indeed as much as their Cauſe would bear I think) and dictated by a ſober compoſed and gentle Spirit, and the concernment of the Book to be of <hi>exceeding Moment,</hi> especially in relation to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>which</hi> (I believe) hath more of that ſort of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers then any three Counties in <hi>England</hi> have: I have therefore thought it worth the while to examine their Book, ſo far as I am concerned in it; with what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs (Reader) thou muſt be Judge, and the Lord guide thee in Judgement, both as to this, and every truth: So prays,</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118929:20"/> made uſe of the ſame Scripture for the <hi>Sedes</hi> of their Arguments: But that our Brethren ſhould take my <hi>Vindiciae miniſterii Evangelioi</hi> to be one of them, either ſpeaks their (too much) reſpect for me; or their policy to magnifie that Enemy whom they conceive they have conquered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For my Pamphlet; it was written ſeven years ſince, commanded (almoſt) to the Preſs by an holy and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervant of God (now with God) Mr. <hi>Jeremy Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,</hi> who was with me, when I was writing; and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the need, or expedience of ſuch a Pamphlet, he told me he was of <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s mind, who would have every body write againſt <hi>Pelagius.</hi> It was occaſioned at firſt, by the troubleſomneſs of a gifted man (as himſelf judged) in communion with me, who had a great am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to be expounding Scripture; and (in a teach) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we would not allow it, afterwards left us, and joynd himſelf, with a Congregational Church, who had no better opinion of his gifts than we had before, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained his luſt in that ambition too; and in a like teach, he left them and turned <hi>Quaker.</hi> For the ſatisfaction of thoſe Chriſtians in communion with me, upon the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble given us by this perſon, I firſt (at private meetings of Chriſtians in communion with me) diſcourſed the things in my Book; afterwards Printed them. It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God ſo far to bleſs my indeavours, that ſince that time, none of thoſe committed to my charge have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to attempt any ſuch practice; and it hath pleaſed God ſo far to give my Printed Book ſucceſs, that I think it hath been twice Printed, and ſeveral perſons (ſome of quality) have returned me thanks, for my poor labours in it. And our Brethren having ſingled me out for a combatant once more in this quarrel; I ſhall indeavour to diſcharge the duty they have impoſed upon me, and to do it with the ſame moderation, and ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which they profeſs, and (for ought I obſerve yet) have practiſed.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118929:20"/>3. Our Brethren in the firſt Chapter do two things. 1. They <hi>Open the term Miniſtry.</hi> 2. <hi>The term Office.</hi> 3. They raiſe two Queſtions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether the Office of the Miniſtry doth corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the work, or to the Church?</hi> If our Brethren would have been content, that it <hi>ſhould have</hi> been in its relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divided, we ſhould not have oppoſed it: But affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it is no relate to the work, but only to the Church, I muſt profeſs my ſelf diſſatisfied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether the Office of the Miniſtry doth corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, or only to the particular Church?</hi> Our Brethren ſay, <hi>Only to the particular Church;</hi> If our Brethren would have been content with a diviſion again, that the Miniſter ſhould be related to both, we ſhould have granted it; or if our Brethren had ſtated the queſtion about the relation of a Miniſter to ſuch a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as had conſtant ſtanding Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Officers, we know no ſuch Church, and ſhould not have diſputed <hi>de</hi> or <hi>pro non ente:</hi> But (as they ſtate it) I muſt profeſs my ſelf alſo in this of another mind, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe that a Miniſter is in Office to more than his particular Church: And therefore to triall we muſt go.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In the opening of the term Miniſtry, Our Brethren tell us that Miniſtry ſtands in oppoſition to Lordly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, Mat. <hi>20.25, 26, 27.</hi> that thoſe who do acts of miniſtration, are Miniſters; that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and the words uſed in Scripture to expreſs Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Miniſtry, are applied, in Scripture, to others beſide Miniſters in Office: that their conſtant perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming acts of miniſtration, entituleth them to the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Miniſters; and their work ſhould be called Preaching, as we uſually call them, <hi>Bruers,</hi> or <hi>Bakers,</hi> who brew, or bake conſtantly; and therefore Chriſtians ſhould ſo call them.</q> This is the ſum of what they have, <hi>p.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. To all which, I ſhall crave leave to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118929:21"/> anſwer. For this ſeemeth to be an old <hi>hedge of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which who ſo breaks the Serpent of Confuſion will bite him</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the terms <hi>Miniſter, Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> are of various interpretations both in civil, and ſacred uſage, is unqueſtionable. Theſe terms therefore fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the queſtions, the explication, and limitation of them, to the ſenſe in which we underſtand them ſeems neceſſary. An accurate diſcourſe of a queſtion, requires, that no ſignification of the terms in it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Explication. <hi>In plenâ tractatione, vocis diſtinctio nunquam eſt omittenda</hi> (ſay <hi>Logicians.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the firſt term therefore [Miniſter] that it is a Latine word, none can doubt, nor that in ordinary uſe it ſignifies no more that a Servant, one <hi>who worketh for another as his Lord and Maſter;</hi> ſo called, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is to his Maſter <hi>a manibus,</hi> an hand ſervant, <hi>quaſi maniſter</hi> (as <hi>Perottus</hi> will have it) or becauſe he is leſs than his Maſter, <hi>quia minor in ſtatione;</hi> (which is <hi>Iſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>'s notion, and preferred by learned <hi>Martinius.</hi>) In this notion the word is frequently uſed by civil and prophane Authors, <hi>Infimi homines miniſtros ſe praebent,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tully. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Orat:</hi> and again, <hi>lib. de Amicitiâ, —Libidinis miniſtri,</hi> ſo <hi>Ovid</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—illo dicunt Mactata Miniſtro</l>
                  <l>Corpora—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The holy Penmen of Scripture, (either moved, from the congruity of the native ſignification of the word, or the notion of it accrewing by general uſage) have ſometimes uſed it to ſignifie one <hi>who is the Servant of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the</hi> great work <hi>of Preaching the Goſpel;</hi> at leſt our tranſlators (interpreting what they wrote in another language) have done ſo. The original words which they have ſo interpreted are <gap reason="foreign">

There are indeed two other Texts, which ſome may miſtake into this ſenſe, <hi>Lu.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.5. In the firſt, it is ſaid Chriſt clozed up the Book, and gave it to the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi> in the latter, <hi>John</hi> is called the Miniſter of <hi>Paul and Barnabas.</hi> Thoſe who write about the Jewiſh uſages tell us they had an Officer, belonging to the <hi>Temple</hi> (ſomething I think akin to our Pariſh Clerks) who was wont, to bring, and carry away the Book of the Law, to or from the <hi>Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Levite,</hi> or other perſon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.

You may take the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus. <hi>The Miniſter is one taken from amongſt men, and ordained for men in things pertaining to God, for the diſpenſation of Publick Ordinances;</hi> and <hi>miniſterium</hi> is but a collective term, as we call the company of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, the Magiſtracy of a Nation; So we call the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Miniſters, <hi>the Miniſtry.</hi> So <hi>Aretius, Bucanus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Martinius, miniſterium eſt ipſe quoque mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</hi> So <hi>Ravanella, Munus vel functio</hi> vocatur <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterium,</hi> for which he quotes many Texts of Scripture; and ſo interpreteth many of thoſe I before cited; the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. and that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 12. ſeem very inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this interpretation.</p>
            <p>And here again, our Brethren ſeem to play with an equivocall term, when they tell us, that the ſpeaking of gifted Brethren may be called <hi>Miniſtry, for there is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration in their ſervice;</hi> ſo there is too in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants waiting upon them at their Tables; yet I hope, they will allow common people, not to call the work of their Servants, waiting at their Trenchers, the <hi>Work of the Miniſtry;</hi> which yet follows by the ſame argument. If our Brethren ſay, that the gifted perſons miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, ſo doth he that ſweeps the Church; yet his work is not <hi>the work of the Miniſtry,</hi> as we have learned to ſpeak. If they ſay, they miniſter unto Chriſt, <hi>Sub judice lis eſt;</hi> That queſtion is yet to diſpute upon the Apoſtles maxim, <hi>His Servants you are whom you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey;</hi> and it is ſtill to be argued betwixt them and us, whether in their miniſtration, they obey the commands of Jeſus Chriſt, yea or no.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Third Term.</note>The third and laſt term is that of <hi>Office;</hi> A term as ambiguous as any other, it comes from the Latine word <hi>Officium.</hi> Hee that will look that word in <hi>Martinius</hi> his <hi>Lexicon Philologicum,</hi> will find at leaſt eight ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of it. Our Brethren of <hi>London,</hi> in their <hi>Jus divinum miniſterii Evangelici,</hi> p. 3. have given us a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118929:24"/> of it, ſo far as to limit it from <hi>homonymie,</hi> and to give the ſenſe of it in the preſent queſtion, which deſcription, our other diſſenting Brethren have faithfully tranſcribed thus.</p>
            <q>The Office of the Miniſtry is a ſpirtual relation to the whole employment of the Miniſtry, in a perſon qualified, founded upon a ſpeciall and regular call.</q>
            <p>Our Brethren, <hi>p.</hi> 3. apprehend this to be faulty, and they declare their diſſent, and the grounds of it, becauſe (as they rightly apprehend) much of the controverſie hangs upon this hinge.</p>
            <p>They grant that <hi>Office is a relation with reſpect to an employment as its end.</hi>
            </p>

               <q>But that it is a relation to the employment of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry as its <hi>Correlate</hi> they deny; the <hi>Church</hi> they ſay is the <hi>Correlate;</hi> and they ſay, the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters confeſs this, <hi>p.</hi> 151. where they ſay the Miniſter hath a relation to the Catholick, as well as to the particu-Church, ſo that they ſeem to contradict themſelves.</q> This is the ſubſtance of what they ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 4. Whence they propound to ſpeak to two queſtions.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <q>

            <p>They are (both of them) very important queſtions.

            <p>That the Office of the Miniſtry doth correlate to the perſons towards whom it is to be executed, is moſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on our parts confeſſed: But that it ſhould be no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate to the work, is (I confeſs) ſuch an abſurdity in

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Office, and work of the Miniſtry, have at leaſt one of theſe references each to another.— Ergo.</hi>

            <p>If they ſay the <hi>Office</hi> neither hath its whole <hi>being</hi> in the work, <hi>nor is any other way</hi> related to it, I think they deny common ſenſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But our Brethren having brought us four Arguments, it is fit we ſhould examine them. For the firſt they ſay, the work cannot be a Correlate to the Office, <q>Becauſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118929:25"/> 
                  <hi>Relations cannot be ſeparated;</hi> they are <hi>ſimul naturâ,</hi> take away one, and you muſt take away the other: but the work of the Miniſtry, by the ſickneſs, death, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, or rejection of the Miniſter may ceaſe; and yet according to our principles, the office doth not ceaſe, a man is a Miniſter in office, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do the work. Hence they obſerve, that whereas our Brethren of <hi>London,</hi> thought that by fixing the relation between the work and the office (becauſe, a Miniſter may be ſeparated from his Church) they had ſecured the permanency of the office. Theſe <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> think, that they have deeply fallen into the ſame pit, becauſe the <hi>work may ceaſe.</hi>
               </q> This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>p.</hi> 5. which in form, is thus.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Relations and Correlations, exiſt and periſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But <hi>(according to your principle)</hi> ſo do not the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and work of the Miniſtry. <hi>Therefore they are no relations.</hi>—</p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> they ſay, is the Certain rule of <hi>Relations,</hi> (in Logick.)</p>
            <p>The minor they prove, becauſe we will not ſay, the office of the Miniſtry in a man ceaſeth, when he is kept from doing his work by ſickneſs, impriſonment, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rejection, &amp;c. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They call the major, the <hi>Certain rule of Relations.</hi> But neither tell us <hi>of what Relations,</hi> nor in what ſenſe, Logicians underſtand that rule and reaſon will enforce for the underſtanding. I will therefore tell them, we know our Brethren are not to learn, that Relations are of two ſorts. The firſt Logicians call <hi>Relata ſecundum eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,</hi> real relations. Such, whoſe whole being (as relations) lye in their relation; ſuch are the Relations of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son, Huſband</hi> and <hi>Wife, Maſter</hi> and <hi>Servant.</hi> The Father (as a Father) hath no other being, but in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a Son, and ſo of the reſt; this is called <hi>Relatio
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118929:26"/> praedicamentalis,</hi> of theſe Relations, their rule (rightly underſtood) is true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, there are other <hi>Relations</hi> too, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Logick, <hi>Relata ſecundum dici,</hi> nominal relations, yet ſuch as have a reality of Relation, but not ſuch a one, that all the being of the Relations (as ſuch) is wrapt up in their relation; this relation they call <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio tranſcendentalis:</hi> As now, <hi>Scibile &amp; Scientia,</hi> A thing to be known, and the knowledge of this thing are relations; and inſtanced in as ſuch by moſt Logicians.</p>
            <p>Yet neither the one, nor the other of theſe relations, have all their being in their relations. Of theſe Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we ſay (and all ſay) the <hi>Rule is falſe,</hi> and reaſon will enforce it. For example. This 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> there is a knowledge exiſtent <hi>of the nature of an Eclypſe,</hi> but the <hi>Eclypſe</hi> which is the thing to be known is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent. The knowledge of the nature of <hi>thunder</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent: But it doth not thunder. So that our Brethrens Argument runs upon a ſuppoſition, that we ſay, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and the work are <hi>Relata ſecundum eſſe,</hi> Relations of the firſt ſort, but we are not of that mind; for we think, the whole eſſence of office lyeth not in its Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; But in <hi>that authority,</hi> wherewith the perſon is <hi>clothed by his ordination,</hi> which holds when his perſon is reſtrained from the exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> In eodem enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis gradu vel ut Ens in actu, vel ut Ens in poteſtate. Zabarel.</note>Secondly, ſaith <hi>Zabarel,</hi> the Rule is true, that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions exiſt and periſh together, as to the ſame degree of being. A man is not actually an Officer, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do his Office, but the <hi>habit</hi> remaines in him ſo long as there is a poſſibility that he may one day do it. The <hi>Mayor of Norwich,</hi> is my Lord Protectors Officer, for the Government of the City; and none in their ſober mind, but will ſay, he is <hi>Mayor,</hi> and the government of the City are related each to other. Suppoſe the <hi>Mayor</hi> now ſick, or in priſon, is he not an officer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at preſent he cannot execute his Office? Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118929:26"/> to the firſt anſwer, we deny the major; and by vertue of the ſecond, we deny the minor. And we hope our Brethren will deny the Concluſion.</p>
            <p>Hence (Chriſtian Reader) thou mayeſt ſee our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren deal not kindly with thee, when they tell thee, <q>As well may you affirm a man to be a Father, who hath no Son, nor child; or a man to be an husband, who hath no wife, as you may affirm a man to be a Miniſter, who hath no employment.</q> For theſe are relations that widely differ from the Relation betwixt an <hi>officer and his work.</hi> A <hi>Father,</hi> (as he is a Father) is a thing hath no being without a child; and ſo cannot be: but an officer, if at preſent he hath no work, yet hath (as an officer) an authority and power to do ſuch a work, when he hath opportunity. I would fain know of our Brethren, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man may not be in the office of a <hi>Colonel,</hi> though at preſent, he hath neither men to make up a Regiment, nor conſequently the government of them: It is his Commiſſion makes him an Officer, and authorizeth him to gather a Regiment, and execute his authority, as ſoon as he hath opportunity. Neither do we ſay, a man can be no officer, who hath no employment, but we ſay, a man may be an officer, who at preſent may want oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do what is his employment, and he is by his office authorized unto. And now I ſuppoſe, every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will underſtand the weakneſs of our Brethrens firſt Argument, which Logicians call a fallacy <hi>A dicto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid, ad dictum ſimpliciter:</hi> Their ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in ſum this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Relations and Correlations exiſt together; but the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label> muſt neceſſarily be before the work; becauſe it is a means in order to the end. Therefore the office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and the work cannot be Correlates.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Reader</hi> will eaſily ſee the bottom of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſame <hi>Canon</hi> in Logick, which was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the other Argument. We grant that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118929:27"/> is a means, in order to the work as its end; and we ſay, that the office muſt be before, the work. But we ſay, theſe are no ſuch relations as muſt neceſſarily be <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul Naturâ,</hi> and exiſt together; except they mean <hi>in eodem entitatis gradu,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſunt ſimul,</hi> they are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though they do not <hi>exiſt</hi> together; conſider them as <hi>Entia in poteſtate,</hi> they are <hi>Simul Natura,</hi> and ſo it is not neceſſary, that the means ſhould be before the End; In ſhort the very ſame anſwer ſerveth as before.</p>

               <p>That which the Goſpel owneth as the Correlate to the Miniſters office, that is the Correlate.</p>

            <p>The <hi>major</hi> we confeſs, but ſay there wants a word in it. That which [alone] the Goſpel owns, is the only Correlate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> we deny, we confeſs that the Goſpel owns the <hi>Church</hi> as a Correlate to the office of the Miniſtry, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.27.

We can ſhew them many, where they are called the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſs, of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Now it is a rule, <hi>Relata reciprocantur,</hi> a Father is called the Father of ſuch a Son, and the Son is called the Son of ſuch a Father. But I ſay, our Brethren ſpeak no <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe,</hi> when they call <hi>Miniſters (i. e.</hi> Preaching Miniſters) Miniſters of ſuch a Church; they are the Miniſters of God, and his Goſpel in ſuch a Church; and they have ſome relation to the Church, but not a more relation than they have to the work; they are call'd Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the Goſpel is called
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118929:28"/> their Goſpel; <hi>My Goſpel,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> twice; here is a plain reciprocation; let them ſhew us the like, if they can, for their aſſertion; otherwiſe we hope, our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an friends will hardly be induced by ſuch kind of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation as this is, to believe the office of the Miniſtry is not related to the work of the Miniſtry, but only to the perſons whom the miniſtation doth concern.</p>
            <p>And I earneſtly beſeech our Brethren, that they would not indeavour to abuſe ſimple ſoules with theſe wofull <hi>fallacies,</hi> which have not (as you ſee) the leaſt foundation; either in Scripture, reaſon, or uſage of any approved Authors.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, we will grant them, that there is a relation betwixt the office of the Miniſtry and the <hi>Church</hi> in which they execute their office.</p>
            <p>But if we would grant our <hi>Brethren,</hi> that the office of the Miniſtry is a <hi>Correlate,</hi> not to the work, but to the Church, I perceive this would not give them ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; unleſs we would alſo yield them, that it is a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate</hi> only to a <hi>particular Church,</hi> In oppoſition, not only to the <hi>Church Catholick inviſible,</hi> viz. the whole number of the Elect ſcattered abroad; But to the <hi>Church Catholick viſible,</hi> in any notion.<note place="margin">The Preacher ſent chap. 2.</note> This they now come to aſſert <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. This indeed is the great <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na-Notion,</hi> but we can by no meanes bow down unto it. And therefore, that's the next thing we muſt bring to trial. Only before we do it, Give me leave to inform our Brethren, in our notion of a Church; though I ſhall better do it, when I ſhall return to anſwer their Epiſtle.</p>

            <p>By the Church univerſal, <hi>quatenus</hi> viſible, we mean <hi>The whole number of people, over the face of the Earth, called out of the Paganiſh world, to the owning of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt;</hi> which being an integral Body, conſ ſting of <hi>homogeneous</hi> members, or parts, each part beareth the denomination of the whole; hence that part of this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is in a <hi>Nation, Province, pariſh,</hi> &amp;c. is properly called the <hi>Church</hi> of God, in ſuch a <hi>Region, Nation, Province, pariſh, &amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to perſecute the Church, <hi>Acts.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.13. that is, all that own<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned the goſpel, whether in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or in <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> or the <hi>ſtrange Cities,</hi> Acts 8. chap. 9. chap 26.11. all that called on <hi>Chriſts name,</hi> whom he could come near, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.14.</p>
            <p>Now beſides theſe more general diſtributions of a Church, the Church as <hi>Viſible,</hi> is capable of ſeveral <hi>ſtates,</hi> from whence ariſe 3 other notions of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a more imperfect ſtate of it as conſidered without <hi>Officers,</hi> this Divines call an <hi>Entitive</hi> or <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> Church, which is nothing elſe, but any <hi>particular number,</hi> any part of that company before mentioned,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118929:29"/> who are found in any <hi>Nation, Province, City, Pariſh,</hi> ſo called out of the paganiſh world, agreeing in the profeſſion of the Goſpel. In this ſenſe I allwaies thought, that we and our brethren of the congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perſwaſion had been agreed, that there are National, Provincial, and Parochial Churches.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a ſecond notion of the Church, reſulting from the conſideration of this body, as having ſome <hi>ſet over it</hi> clothed with the authority of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, authorized as his embaſſadours to preach the Goſpel, and to Baptize, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To open this notion a little. We conſider, that it ſeemed good to the wiſdome of God, to commiſſionate certain perſons to preach the goſpel, that by it the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God might be <hi>gathered together in one;</hi> Hence Chriſt when hee aſcended up on high, gave gifts unto men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. He gave ſome <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> theſe were to lay the foundation, and then <hi>Prophets,</hi> theſe were to be Inſtrumental in the building. And by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> he conſtituted <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> (who were as to power) little leſs than <hi>Provincial Apoſtles,</hi> and by theſe <hi>Paſtors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers:</hi> Hence the Apoſtles created <hi>Evangeliſts, Philip, Timothy, Titus;</hi> and both the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and theſe <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi> ordained <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> Acts 14.23. 1 Tim. 4.14. by faſting, prayer and impoſition of hands, and in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (containing the ſtanding rules, for the ſettling of <hi>Churchs,</hi> in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent ſtate) <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> being ſhortly to ceaſe) rules are given for the conſtitution of theſe officers to the end of the world; now when in any place, God hath called a people from <hi>Paganiſm</hi> to the profeſſion of his Goſpel, and ſet over that people any of theſe perſons ſet apart for the preaching of the Goſpell, we ſay there is in ſuch a Nation, Province, City, Pariſh, a <hi>Miniſterial Church,</hi> which is a ſtate of of the Church more perfect than the former, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118929:30"/> from it, we (I ſay) for diſtinction ſake) call it a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That is a Company of people called out of the Pagan world to an owning of the Goſpel of Chriſt, among whom alſo, are ſome clothed with the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, for the preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</hi> According to that commiſſion, <hi>Go Preach and Baptize.</hi> Indeed as to the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, in regard that none are to be admitted to it but ſuch as can <hi>examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and the ſteward of Chriſts <hi>myſteries muſt be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> in order to which, there muſt be an act of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> paſs upon the Receiver, which is <hi>jurisdiction;</hi> and Eccleſiaſtical <hi>jurisdiction</hi> is no where committed to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now the queſtion is, whether he that is a preaching Elder in ſuch a particular Church, or indeed, rather whether all the preaching Elders in all the particular Churches in the world, have any farther relation, or be in any office, to any but that particular company, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which they are (reſpectively) more eſpecially ſet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot watch over all, &amp;c.

               </p>
            </q>
            <p>And this is it (as Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> hath noted) which hath made ſo many ſtumble at the notion of a <hi>Church Catholick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical;</hi> and upon this ſtone, our Brethren have ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in their Epiſtle.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="2">2.

We do not ſay he is <hi>bound to do it in all places,</hi> that is impoſſible, nor to travel up and down (as the Apoſtles were) for that work is ceaſed, at leaſt as to thoſe places where people have received the goſpel. But we ſay he may do it as opportunity is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And we believe, that in caſe it were with us as it is with our brethren in New England, The Church <hi>might by fasting and prayer and impoſition of hands,</hi> ſet apart ſome particular perſons to the office of the miniſtry, without a particular deſignation of them to this or that place, but only deſigning them as the officers of Chriſt to preach the Goſpel amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to baptize ſuch as ſhould receive the Goſpel; and (though not by their ſingle Act as the Apoſtles) yet by the advice of the Church, and with their aſſiſtance, theſe might ordain Elders in their Cities, and form them up into complete Goſpel order; yet the office of ſuch would differ from that of the Apoſtles, both in regard of their miſſion being more <hi>ordinary,</hi> and alſo in regatd of their <hi>power</hi> being more limitted.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, let us conſider our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Arguments: their firſt reduced into form is this,
<q>
                  <p>"What the Goſpel knoweth not, no Goſpel offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers can be correlates unto.<note place="margin">Of Preaching without ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. cap. 2 p. 8.</note>

                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. At the firſt daſh, our Brethren here take away the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118929:33"/> ſubject, or at leaſt the <hi>ſuppoſitum</hi> of the queſtion: The <hi>ſuppoſitum</hi> of the queſtion is, <hi>That there is a Church Particular and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal.</hi> The queſtion is to which of theſe <hi>the office of the Miniſtry is related?</hi> They <hi>ſay to the Church Particular, we ſay to the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal:</hi> to prove their aſſertion they tell us there is no <hi>Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</hi> This is foul diſputing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, The whole may be granted, and yet nothing proved by it: for whether the Goſpel knowes a Church univerſal under a <hi>political</hi> form or no, is not the queſtion, it is enough if it knowes a <hi>Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> under any notion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly the minor is falſe, as Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proves: the Church univerſal is in ſcripture ſet out under the notions of a political body; it is called a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> a <hi>City,</hi> &amp; Jews and Gentiles are called <hi>fellow-citizens;</hi> it is called an <hi>Army</hi> terrible with Banners, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10. ſee Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> more p. 133, 134, 135, &amp;c. for it nothing concerns me as to the preſent queſtion, as I ſaid before.</p>
            <q>Their next and only argument is again drawn from the names and titles given unto theſe officers, viz. <hi>Paſtors, teachers,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.11. <hi>Overſeers,</hi> Acts. 20.28. 1 Tim 3.2. Titus 1.7.</q>
            <p>Themſelves form their argument thus, or at leaſt ſhould have formed it thus. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Church alone which is committed to miniſters charge to feed, teach, and overſee, is the Church to which the office of the miniſtry is a correlate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the univerſal Church is not that Church which is committed to a Miniſter to feed, teach, and overſee,— Ergo,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſure that the Argument muſt run thus, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the queſtion, which at preſent is not, whether a <hi>particular miniſter,</hi> but whether the office of the miniſtry (reſiding in all miniſters) be a correlate to the particular,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118929:34"/> or to the Univerſal Church. And therefore our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren may ſee a fault in their laying of their Argument if they will but compare it with the queſtion ſtated by themſelves.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Now to the argument thus formed I anſwer, By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying both the propoſitions. I deny that,</hi> That Church alone which is committed to a miniſters charge to feed, teach, and overſee is the Church to which the office of the miniſtry is a correlate.</q>
            <p>For I ſuppoſe that our Brethren mean, which is more eſpecially committed to his charge, as paſtor thereof, in a reſtrained ſenſe; if they do ſo, I ſay that Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is not <hi>correlate</hi> to his office, or to the office of the miniſtry, becauſe another Church, viz. the <hi>catholike Church,</hi> is alſo in ſome ſenſe committed to his charge, viz. ſo far as <hi>pro re natâ</hi> (as occaſion ſerveth) he may and ought to feed others beſides that Church, yea ſuch as are of no Church, but may (for ought he knowes) be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the inviſible Church of Gods elect, and ſo his office doth relate to them.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly the Minor is apparently falſe, viz. That the particular Church is <hi>that alone which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a miniſters eharge, to feed, teach, and overſee. Go preach the goſpel to every creature,</hi> is a commiſſion which hath put all the reaſonable world under the charge of the miniſteral office. And although (as our Brethren of London ſay right) that no miniſter is an <hi>Actual Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, viz.</hi> in theſe two ſenſes, 1 <hi>None can be here and there and every where,</hi> thus the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is only an Univerſal actual teacher. Nor ſecondly <hi>is any Minister (ſet in a particular Church) bound,</hi> as the <hi>Apostles, to an itinerant Execution of his office:</hi> yet our Brethren of London do not ſay but that if three parts of this Nation were heathens, the Church may by faſting and prayer and laying on of hands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the office of the Miniſtry uppon ſome perſons with a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118929:34"/> ſpecial deſignation of them as Chriſts officers to carry the Goſpel to people all over the Nation; or over the world. Neither do our Brethren of London ſay but that he who is a fixed miniſter in a particular Church, wherever he preacheth, preacheth as an officer of Chriſt in the worke of the Goſpel, whom people are bound to hear; nor do they ſay that he who is a fixed miniſter in a particular Church may not by vertue of his miniſterial office (ſo far as his opportunity, ſtrength, and finite nature gives him leave) feed and teach by the word, and as a miniſter overſee any others that are not members of his particular Church, Though indeed that be in a more ſpecial manner committed to his truſt, care, and overſight.</p>
            <p>But I obſerve that our Brethrens argument, though put into the beſt form I could, and cured of one fault, yet is ſick of another; and indeed the Argument ſhould have run thus.</p>
            <q>That Church, or thoſe Churches alone which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all miniſters reſpectively to feed, teach, and overſee, reſpectively are the Churches to which the office of the miniſtry is a correlate.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>But thoſe Churches are only particular Churches.</hi>— Ergo.</p>
            <p>As they put it, there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s a great fallacy in it; for ſuppoſe this or that particular Miniſter had no work appointed him by Jeſus Chriſt to do, but onely in his particular Church, and ſo the office of the Miniſtry, as it reſided in that ſingle man, were only a Correlate to his particular Church; Yet it would not follow, That the office of the Miniſtry, as it reſides in every particular Miniſter in the world, had no other Correlate; for all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches in the world, make up the univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>Though the office of a Juſtice of Peace, as it reſides in this, or that particular perſon, is limited by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118929:35"/> to ſuch a County, is only a Correlate to the people of ſuch a County: Yet ſurely the office of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace, as it reſides in the whole number of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Peace in <hi>England,</hi> is a relation to the whole Nation as a Correlate, becauſe the whole Nation is made up of thoſe Counties, and the office reſiding in ſome or other of them as to every County, muſt needs relate to the whole. It is true, this is not all which we aſſert; for we ſay, that in Gods Commonwealth, Miniſters (though ordinarily charged more eſpecially as to ſome part with the feeding, care and overſight of that part) yet as to ſome miniſterial acts are authorized alſo, to the whole, or to act in any part, not that they muſt act in all caſes, but that they may act, at leſt in ſome caſes. But there was enough ſaid before to the Argument; this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fault the phraſing of it to impoſe a fallacy upon us.</p>
            <p>I find nothing more in their 10, 11, 12, and 13. pages to prove their minor, ſave only one Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. Where the Apoſtle ſpeaking to the Elders of the <hi>Church of Epheſus,</hi> bids them to <hi>take heed unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nor is it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> was a particular Church. See the Aſſemblies Propoſ. and Reaſons, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>and unto all the flock of which Chriſt had made them overſeers.</hi> This Text indeed proves what none denies, <hi>viz.</hi> that every Miniſter is to take care of every ſoul, over whom God hath given him a ſpecial charge; but I cannot ſee how this Text proves, that the people of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were thoſe only to whom the Miniſters were ſet in relation. If God ſhould ſay to a Miniſter (as in effect he doth in his word,) <hi>Take heed to every ſoul, in this Pariſh, which is thy flock;</hi> would it follow, that he need not take heed to any other? The words do not import that the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were all the flock they were to feed; but that it was their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to feed all them, as being more ſpecially committed to them. If the words indeed had been thus, The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Epheſus</hi> are all the flock of which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118929:35"/> you any overſight, they had been ſomething to our Brethrens purpoſe: This is all our Brethren have argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative in this caſe. Let me now try in a few words, if I cannot by better Arguments prove that the office of the Miniſtry relates not only to the particular Church, but to the Catholick Church, <hi>viz. That they may do acts of office and authority, beyond the bounds of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church over which they are more eſpecially ſet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe whom God hath given for the edifying of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> of Chriſt, are related to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But God hath given Paſtors and Teachers, for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the body of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.12, 13. The <hi>minor</hi> is the letter of Scripture, the major I prove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church be the body of Chriſt; and thoſe who are given for the edifying of it are related to it; Then thoſe whom God hath given for the edifying of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, are related to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church is the body of Chriſt; and thoſe who are of God given for it, are related to it.</hi> —Ergo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſequence</hi> is unqueſtionable. The Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſts of two aſſertions; one I ſuppoſe that none who knows the definition of <hi>relata,</hi> will deny, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe whom God hath given for his Church are related to it. If any deny, <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church is the Body of Christ</hi> (there meant) <hi>I prove it. Either the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, or the particular Church is there meant. But not the particular Church</hi>—Ergo.</p>
            <p>I prove the aſſumption. <hi>If Christ hath but one my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical body, then particular Churches</hi> (which are many) <hi>cannot be there meant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Chriſt hath but one myſtical body? I prove the minor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Scripture ſpeaks but of one mystical body of Christ, and ſayes Christ is not divided, then we ought not to aſſert that he hath more bodies than one, or that he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:118929:36"/>
            <p>But the Scripture <hi>mentions but one body of Christ, and ſaith Christ is not divided,</hi> Ergo. Thoſe who deny the minor muſt produce thoſe Scriptures which aſcert Chriſt to have more than one body.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is plain from this argument, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. of the Univerſal Church. From this argument.</p>
            <q>
               <p>That Church for which God gave Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for, <hi>he alſo</hi> gave pastors and teachers for, <hi>Eph. 4.12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> he gave Apostles and Prophets for the Catholike Church—<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>I think none will be ſo abſurd as to ſay that Apoſtles and Prophets were given for a particular Church: for then according to our Brethrens principles, their work muſt have been terminated there.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label> A ſecond argument is this.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Thoſe whom God hath commiſſioned to preach and Baptize all Nations, are not related only to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, but to the Catholike Church, yea to the whole world.</p>
               <p>But God hath commiſſionated his ministers <hi>to</hi> go preach and Baptize all Nations. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The major is Evident, for all Nations ſignifies more than a particular Church. The minor only can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>
            <p>In proof of which we bring that known text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations</hi>—&amp;c. <hi>I am with you to the End of the world.</hi> If our Brethren ſhall ſay this was a commiſſion only to the Apoſtles, they ſhake hands with <hi>Socinus, Smalcius,</hi> and <hi>Theophilus Nicolaides;</hi> who indeed tell us that the Apoſtles were <hi>fundamentum Eccleſia,</hi> and could have no ſucceſſors: and deſert all proteſtant writers, and are confuted by the <hi>promiſe</hi> annexed, for Chriſt would not have promiſed a <hi>perpetual preſence</hi> to a <hi>temporary employment.</hi> What
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118929:36"/> elſe our Brtheren ſay to this text, ſhall in due place be conſidered.</p>
            <p>A third Argument I ſhall draw <hi>ab abſurdo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That opinion which diſchargeth all people from a duty in attending upon the word publikely preached by a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter out of his particular Church, &amp; makes it impoſſible for any people (not of that Miniſters Church) to go in faith to hear any ſuch Sermon, and makes it ſinfull for any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to receive the Sacrament, otherwhere than in his own Church, or of his own paſtor, and diſchargeth all people (ſave members of particular formed Churches) from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word publikely preached, and makes private rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding equivalent to it as to any institution, and denies pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ordinances to any people but ſuch as are fixed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of particular Churches, that opinion is abſurd, ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, and falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this opinion <hi>that a Miniſter is only in office to his particular Church</hi> doth all this. —Ergo</p>
            <p>I preſume our Brethren will eaſily grant the <hi>Major,</hi> I will prove the <hi>Minor.</hi> —Ergo.</p>
            <p>The proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> depends upon theſe two principles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>the authority of him who preacheth,</hi> is <hi>that which makes the action of him</hi> that heareth <hi>a duty.</hi> This is ſo rational that none can deny it; for <hi>ſin is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a law,</hi> and all <hi>duty</hi> muſt be an act of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſome law <hi>natural, divine, poſitive</hi> or humane: now this is certain, that Gods law hath not commanded me to hear every one that ſpeaketh a good diſcourſe, or reads a chapter, he muſt be ſpecially <hi>authorized</hi> to preach, or I ſhall not be <hi>ſpecially obliged</hi> to hear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond principle is this, <hi>That an act of office cannot be done by him who is no officer.</hi> I think that none in their right wits will deny this; hence I ſay theſe five abſurdities will notoriouſly follow, from this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:118929:37"/>1. That in all places where are no <hi>particular Churches formed, let who will preach none are bound to come to hear,</hi> but they may all ſtay at home, and read a good book if they pleaſe; for none there hath any <hi>authority</hi> or <hi>is in office to preach,</hi> and ſo none under an obligation to hear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if you divide <hi>England</hi> into an hundred parts, ninety-nine of them <hi>cannot upon the Lords day wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any publike Ordinance,</hi> which ſhall lie under a more appointment of God to ſave their ſouls, than reading a chapter at home doth. The reaſon, is becauſe no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches are formed, and there can be <hi>none in office.</hi> It is not the place, or company, but the perſon adminiſtring, who makes the ordinance publike.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Where there is a particular Church formed,</hi> it is true, the members are bound to come <hi>on the Lords day and hear their officer,</hi> but for all others, if they do ſtay at home and read a chapter, or a good book, they ſin not: for he that preacheth hath no more authority to preach to them, than they have to preach at home one to another.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Suppoſe any ſhould <hi>come to hear any man preach, if he be not a member of his particular Church,</hi> he cannot <hi>come in faith,</hi> believing upon the account of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or promiſe, that the word heard ſhall <hi>profit him;</hi> any more than if he had ſtaid at home, and heard his ſervant read a chapter: for he that preacheth ſtands in no office, is clothed with no more authority toward him. No he is only in office to the members of his own Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If any paſtor of any <hi>particular Church, at any time,</hi> uppon any occaſion gives the Sacrament to any one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who is not an actual member of his Church, <hi>he ſinneth againſt God,</hi> doing an act of office, to a perſon to whom he is in no office, and hath no authority. And I am miſtaken if this would not make the greateſt ſchiſm ever yet heard of.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:118929:37"/>
            <p>And now I beſeech my <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> to conſider to what <hi>Athei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m</hi> and confuſion this one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple improved, would in a ſhort time bring us. And I am verily perſwaded, that moſt of our Brethren of the <hi>Congregational</hi> perſwaſion, are of another mind from theſe three in this point: for ſo wiſe, and learned men can never (ſurely) think, that when at any time, they preach in any place, or to any people ſaving to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſpective Churches, they preach but as gifted brethren, ſo that a weavers diſcourſe who hath ſpent all his week in his loom, is under as much appointment of Gods, for the ſalvation of ſouls, as theirs, is, yet this is a true concluſion from this principle; up to which alſo our brethren cannot walk unleſs each of the Churches keep ſo diſtinct, as never to have communion Each with other in any act of publike worſhip to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by an officer: which would unqueſtionably be the higheſt ſchiſm in the world.</p>
            <p>As for their third chapter, I might ſpare my pains in anſwering of it, for it is but a concluſion from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, in the firſt, and ſecond chapter, and it is too much to deny the premiſes, and concluſion too. In this third chapter, they give us the deſcription of office, then indeavour to prove it, and laſtly draw two concluſions from it; their deſcription is this.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>A ſecond rule is this, That the definition of a Genus ſhould agree to every ſpecies.</hi> The miniſterial office is a <hi>Genus,</hi> here defined, but there are diverſs miniſters (ſay we) that have no ſuch particular Church, for we cannot think but a miniſter may be ſet apart for the work, though at preſent he hath no place: the order of the Church in ordaining none <hi>Sine titulo</hi> (without a title to a place) was no divine order, but prudential; to avoid the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of a <hi>Vagrant Miniſtery,</hi> and therefore <hi>Hierom</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Ordination from <hi>Paulinus;</hi> becauſe he inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ordaining him to his particular Church: we grant that the office of a <hi>paſtor</hi> in ſtrict ſenſe, doth relate to a particular Church, but not the office of a <hi>paſtor</hi> in a more large ſenſe, and as it is uſed in Scripture, both in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> 3.15. &amp; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. Our Brethren expound their deſcription.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Genus,</hi> we allow what they ſay. Office is <hi>a Relation.</hi> Their terms of relation we deny, we ſay the particular Church is not the only correlate, but the <hi>

To which I anſwer, that our Brethren know that <hi>ſub Judice lis eſt,</hi> it is very diſputable whether a ſingle perſon, or the <hi>Preſbytery</hi> be meant by that term. 2.

            <p>As to the <hi>formal cauſe,</hi> we cannot agree with our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that <hi>a ſpecial regular call is it</hi> (in the ſenſe they underſtand (all), we ſay it is a miniſters <hi>Miſſion</hi> both internal and <hi>External,</hi> and the Apoſtle proveth it, <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> that is, they cannot,<note place="margin">

               <hi>If the Church might chuſe the leſſer officer, then they ought to chuſe the greater.</hi> But this is falſe Logick, our brethren will eaſily ſee it in other things: will theſe things follow?

            <p>Our Brethren from this doctrine fetch two Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries, or inferences. Firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That there is no difference betwixt that which makes a man a miniſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 17. 1 Conc.</note> 
               <hi>and a Miniſter to this or that Church:</hi> The ſecond is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the distinction betwixt preaching ex officio</hi> and <hi>ex dono,</hi> by <hi>office</hi> and by <hi>gift,</hi> is founded on Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Conc.</note>As to the firſt, I have already proved the contrary, for it ſtandeth upon no other foundation than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that <hi>Office relates not to the worke,</hi> but to the Church: Nor to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> but to the <hi>particular Church:</hi> which foundations (I think) I have ſhaken ſo, that til they be repaired they will not bear this ſuper-ſtructure.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond, we allow it in two caſes, firſt for <hi>Trial ſake,</hi> for we have a plain text for it in the caſe of Deacons, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.10. and we may argue <hi>à minori ad majus negativè,</hi> If the loweſt officer of the Church muſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118929:39"/> be firſt proved; then much more the higher officer, I mean ordinary officers, for Apoſtles, &amp;c. were not the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> of officers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In caſes of <hi>Neceſſity.</hi> In times of perſecution where Miniſters in office cannot be had, which was the caſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.

            <p>
               <hi>IT ſeems we are not yet agreed about the ſtate of queſtion: and therefore our Brethren have taken a great deal of pains, from their 19 p. to their 30 to ſtate it for us.</hi> 
               <q>In which they diſtinguiſh both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Subject, and the Predicate.

               </q> 
               <hi>but for ought they know a man may lawfully preach (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in ſome caſes) without ſuch approbation. As to the Predicate.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>By preaching they underſtand any publiſhing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118929:40"/> opening or applying goſpel truthes to any perſons for the uſes and ends they ſerve to, be it in publike, or in private, to a Chriſtian, or to an idolatrous aſſembly; thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the two words in the Greek tranſlated preaching ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, Lu.</hi> 16.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Acts.</hi> 5.42. <hi>Acts.</hi> 8.35. Hence they find fault with our Brethren of London their deſcription of preaching, <hi>Jus divinum</hi> p. 77. &amp; much they ſay to them (who are doubtleſs of age to anſwer for themſelves) &amp;c. Our Brethren diſtinguiſh concerning the term <hi>authoritatively,</hi> they ſay <hi>authority</hi> is taken for a right, and lawfull power, <hi>Lu.</hi> 20.2. Secondly, <hi>for majeſty and gravity, Mar.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2 15. Thirdly, <hi>for office-power.</hi> In the laſt ſenſe they grant it, in the two firſt, they ſay gifted men may preach <hi>authoritatively,</hi> this is the ſubſtance of what they ſay in many words.</q> To all which I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to what our Brethren ſay concerning the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the queſtion (if I miſtake not) it amounts to no more than this, <hi>Every private Chriſtian may not preach, but every one that can or will may,</hi> for what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him? who ſhall be judges of his aptneſs to teach? ſhall the Church? but by what rule? Secondly ſuppoſe he will not ſubmit, ſhall the gifted man ſin? no ſay our Brethren. <hi>It is inexpedient</hi> and may have ill <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents,</hi> but for ought we know it is <hi>lawfull.</hi> So that it is every one that hath a tongue to ſpeak and a minde to ſpeak. Our Brethren tell us, the Church and no other <hi>judged of the abilities of the Deacons</hi> Acts 6. But it was a Church <hi>filled with the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 4.31. A Church of which the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were members: In ſhort, all the Church Chriſt had on the Earth at that time; and let any reader be judge whether becauſe ſuch a Church were thought fit to judge of Miniſters or Deacons abilities; will it follow that every particular Church is? ſo that our Brethren, by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118929:40"/> their limitations of the ſubject have not one jot mended the matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly for the predicate, we will eaſily grant to our Brethren, that the Apoſtles and holy men in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (wanting proper words) made uſe of words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the publike duty of preaching which are uſed in many ſenſes, and that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And we will grant that gifted men may in ſome ſenſe do both; who ever denied to our Brethren, but that a private perſon might declare the glad tidings of the Goſpel to his neighbour, or to his child?

               </gap>is Regiment, &amp;c. But our <hi>Brethren of London</hi> juſtly reſtrained their queſtion to <hi>Authoritative preaching,</hi> by which that we may not quarrel about a ſtrife of words, we mean, that <hi>Preaching which is the ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, to be diſpenſed in the publike aſſemblies of his people, to which all people are bound in conſcience to attend, and which lies under the ſpecial appointment of Chriſt for the ſalvation of ſoules.</hi> If our Brethren pleaſe they may take this more formal deſcription.</p>
            <p>Authoritative preaching, <hi>is an Ordinance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt under the Goſpel, to be diſpenſed in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like aſſemblies of people, by the Preachers opening and applying of the word of God, which he hath appointed, as the ordinary means of faith and ſalvation, to which all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are in Conſcience bound to attend.</hi> Now the queſtion is concerning the inſtituted <hi>adminiſtrator,</hi> whether it be every one that hath gifts, or onely ſuch as are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; we contend for the latter, we ſay in this ſenſe a gifted man cannot preach, nor ought to undertake it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118929:41"/> in this notion. We ſay this is <hi>office-preaching,</hi> for none can thus preach but who is in office. The Authority of this preacher doth two things. 1. <hi>It obligeth him to preach. Woe to me (ſaith Paul) if I do not preach the Goſpel.</hi> 2. <hi>It obligeth people to hear;</hi> for the preacher is to that purpoſe ſent; we ſay then,</p>
            <p n="1">1 A gifted man may in publike or private cry like an <hi>Herald</hi> with a loud and roaring voice, and it may be <hi>Vox &amp; praeterea nihil</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 He may as to the matter <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſpeak of the good things of the Goſpel, either more publikely, or more privately—But we ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He may hold his peace too if he pleaſeth,</hi> for who hath required his ſervice at his hands? Chriſt hath not by his Church ſaid to him <hi>go and preach,</hi> much leſs imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſaid it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He may preach, <hi>But he may preach to the walls too if people pleaſe;</hi> no ſoul ſinneth in neglecting to hear him; they may go if they pleaſe, but Gods word requireth them not to go, nor can any Magiſtrate with a good Conſcience command them to go, any more than he can command me to go to my neighbours houſe to hear him read a chapter: nay if people ſpend the Lords days in hearing ſuch, when they may hear others, it is a ſin unto their ſouls, as much as if they ſhould ſpend their time at home and read chapters; for his preaching is not under ſo much appointment to ſave my ſoul, as my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reading is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For other dayes men may go and hear them if they pleaſe (if no ſcandal be in it, nor other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make it unlawfull) but they cannot <hi>go in faith as to a publike appointment of God, for the ſaving of their ſouls.</hi> On the contrary, he that preacheth authoritatively, 1. <hi>Is bound to preach, if God gives him opportunity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If upon the Lords dayes he preacheth and people will not hear, he may ſhake off the duſt of his feet againſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118929:41"/> them, and it ſhall be more tolerable in the great day for Sidon than for that people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. People may and ought to go out to hear him <hi>in faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lu.</hi> 10.11, 12.</note> believing <hi>that his preaching is the publike Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt for the ſaving of their ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſay, and ſay again, that all the gifted men in the world cannot make one ſuch Sermon. And now our Brethren underſtand what we mean by <hi>authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive preaching;</hi> it is not ſo directly oppoſite to <hi>charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> preaching, as to <hi>precarious preaching,</hi> in which the preacher may begg but cannot command either <hi>audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> or <hi>attention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our Brethren have any thing to ſay to the queſtion thus plainly ſtated, Let them ſpeak on; what ever elſe they ſpeak to is plainly <hi>Ex ignoratione elenchi,</hi> not knowing, or not willing to own what we underſtand by preaching.</p>
            <p>And if this cannot be proved on our Brethrens part, I ſhall beſeech thoſe who have power as civil officers, or particular perſons, to ſend men to places, to take heed whom they ſend, and that they would not lay people under evident temptations to profane the Lords day, and put them upon ſome kinde of neceſſity to hear none but ſuch, as the Lord never ſent, never promiſed his preſence with, and ſuch as they cannot go to hear in ſuch a manner as it is the will of God that people ſhould hear, viz. looking upon the performance as the appointment of Jeſus Chriſt in order to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation. My ſoul akes to think of the condition of many poor people in this county upon that account. But not to digreſs.</p>

            <p>OUr Brethren in this Chapter urge two arguments, for the <hi>Preaching of gifted perſons</hi> without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, p. 29. of their book to p. 60. Their firſt is his.<note place="margin">Preaching without Ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation a. p. 29. ad p 60.</note>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>If Election from a Church ought by Goſpel order to precede Ordination <hi>of</hi> Officers, then perſons not ordained may ordinarily preach.</p>
               <p>But ſuch election ought by Goſpel order to precede Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.—<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Both propoſitions in this argument may ſafely be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed. <q>They prove the Conſequence from the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs that good experience ſhould precede Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for they muſt be perſwaded that he is gifted, and qualified, or they cannot in faith Elect, now this perſwaſion cannot be wrought in them without a mans frequent preaching, to give them this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. </q>This is the ſum of p. 30. To which I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Surpoſing that Election is neceſſary to precede Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, we deny that <hi>ordinary preaching</hi> is neceſſary in order to <hi>Election.</hi> I know no need of any preaching at all, but only to try his <hi>utterance;</hi> his ſoundneſs in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118929:42"/> the faith, and other qualifications are better tried by ordinary converſe than by many Sermons. Thoſe who choſe the Deacons had not 6 monthes experience of them, as is plain from the <hi>Chronology</hi> of the Scripture; twice or thrice <hi>preaching</hi> is enough to try that ſingle gift of <hi>utterance ſurely.</hi>

Secondly we deny the <hi>Minor, ſuch Election, viz.</hi> the Election of a <hi>particular Church</hi> is not neceſſary to precede <hi>Ordination,</hi> nor have our Brethren a title of plain Scripture for it, they only quote, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. v. 5, 6.<note place="margin">See more Ch. 6. of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> To which I ſaid enough before; but let me add, Do our Brethren think that the election there was by the whole multitude? let any one in reaſon judge whether 8000 people &amp; odd (for ſo many was the number at that time, and thoſe of different languages too, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.6.) can reaſonably be ſuppoſed (being alſo divided amongſt themſelves <hi>Acts</hi> 6.1.) to have agreed in that choice; the Apoſtles indeed ſpake to ſome (proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the moſt judicious of them) to commend perſons to them, whereas our Brethren ſay I grant, Ordination is but <hi>Actus ultimus;</hi> he that looks the place [<hi>Vindiciae miniſterii</hi> p. 18.] will ſee my ſenſe. I ſay 1. <hi>In caſe he be paſtor of a Church.</hi> 2. I ſay <hi>examination,</hi> &amp;c. muſt precede. Our Brethren here deſire one text to prove <hi>Ordination</hi> antecedent to, or <hi>without Election.</hi> On the contrary we want one Scripture to prove <hi>Election</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: we grant it indeed upon <hi>parity of reaſon,</hi> for the Paſtor of this or that Church, and judge it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, but I muſt profeſs I ſee not one clear Scripture for it. Doth <hi>Paul</hi> give any ſuch inſtructions to <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> to be obſerved before their <hi>Ordinations?</hi> If there was any, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>Paul and Barnabas</hi> made them; what election do we read of upon the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Paul and Barnabas?</hi> Acts 13.

            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:118929:43"/>
            <p>Our Brethrens ſecond argument is this.</p>
            <q>All that by Goſpel commands are required to preach, they may &amp; ought to preach. But ſome men meerly gifted are ſo required. Ergo.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> we grant <hi>the Minor</hi> we deny. They proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"All that have preaching gifts, and graces, or are apt to teach, are required by Goſpel-commands to preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But ſome men meerly gifted, not ordained, are apt to teach, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> we grant, the <hi>Major</hi> we deny. Our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren inſtance in two texts to prove it: the firſt (upon which they moſt enlarge) is 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. I will crave leave to tranſcribe the 9. too.</p>

            <p>v. 11. <hi>If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God; if any man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be praiſe and dominion for ever. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here our Brethren obſerve ſeveral things.</p>
            <p n="1">"1. <hi>That the text is to be meant of any ſpiritual gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">"2. That v. 11. <hi>There is a particularizing of that ſpecial gift of ſpeaking to others for Edification in the things of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"They ſay p. 33. <q>That the nature of the direction <hi>how to ſpeak,</hi> and the reference the 11. v. hath to the 10. argue it is not <hi>common ſpeaking</hi> here meant, but ſome <hi>ſpecial gift</hi> of <hi>Scripture-interpretation,</hi> and ſo it is uſually carried by interpreters. </q>And it followeth the 10. v. ſo immediately, that it muſt needs be an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it.</p>
            <p n="3">"3. <hi>There is a divine command to exerciſe ſuch gift,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is the Sum of what they ſay. To all which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. 1.

            <p>As to the firſt queſtion then.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is meant by gift there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is uſed in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 16 times, (of which this is one) the learned obſerve it is a word that is not to be found in any hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Author, ſo that from the Scripture alone we muſt underſtand the import of it, where (as by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring all the texts will moſt evidently appear) it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Any good thing which is freely given us of God; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a way of ſpecial providence or common or ſpecial grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is uſed to expreſs gifts of <hi>ſpecial grace. Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Rom.</hi> 5.15, 16. Election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. <hi>Any experiences</hi> which may be imparted for <hi>Edification, Rom.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is uſed to expreſs <hi>extraordinary gifts,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 30.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To expreſs <hi>any gifts common or ſpecial,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To expreſs <hi>common gifts. The gift of continency,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Pauls deliverance from danger</hi> is called a gift, and expreſſed by this word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To expreſs office, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. as appears by the diſtribution, v. 7, 8. So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. (for the impoſition of the hands of the Presbytery did not conferr other gifts ordinary or extraordinary)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118929:44"/> The queſtion is now, in which of theſe ſenſes this word is to be taken, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <p>It is plain that it cannot be meant of thoſe gifts of God which we cannot <hi>Miniſter</hi> to others, ſo that it cannot be underſtood of <hi>Election,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. nor of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 16. nor <hi>eternal Life,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 23. Theſe are indeed <hi>Free-gifts,</hi> beſtowed on the <hi>Elect,</hi> but not to be by them <hi>miniſtred</hi> to others; but of any of the reſt (except that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7.) it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Either of <hi>extraordinary gifts,</hi> ſuch as thoſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, called by this name, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 29 30.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or of <hi>Experiences of Gods goodneſs to us,</hi> in a way of <hi>common providence</hi> or <hi>ſpecial grace,</hi> or of <hi>outward good things, or inward,</hi> which by our <hi>hand,</hi> or <hi>tongue</hi> we may adminiſter, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or of <hi>Acts of office,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Or of the <hi>gifts of knowledge and utterance or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.</p>
            <p>If it be to be underſtood here in any of three former ſenſes, it will not ſerve our brethrens turn; for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts are ceaſed: For telling one another what God hath done for us, or diſtributing to thoſe in want, we allow it to private perſons. If by gift, <hi>Office</hi> is meant, then none but thoſe in office have received the gift.</p>
            <p>As to the laſt, we grant that he who hath received the gift of <hi>utterance and knowlege, may impart it,</hi> and ought to do it in his place, and ſtation, but this may be done, by private <hi>conference, admonitions, exhortations, &amp;c.</hi> But this lies upon our Brethren to prove.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the gift here meant, muſt needs be the gift of preaching in the publike Aſſemblies of people, and that they may do this without Ordination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have told them it may be underſtood,</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Of Office.</hi> As any one hath received any office,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118929:44"/> ſo let him miniſter in it, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p>Or of <hi>common gifts of providence. The good things relating to this life,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 1 11. then it is a command for <hi>alms,</hi> according to the connexion, v. 10, 11. Our Brethren muſt ſhew us good reaſon why it muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of <hi>ſpiritual gifts,</hi> and this gift of preaching.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Or if he be <hi>underſtood of the gift of opening Scripture, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               </hi> it may be underſtood of the <hi>extraordinary gifts of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> or at leaſt muſt be <hi>limited to a due time place &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Or laſtly, <hi>it may be underſtood by the gifts called by this name,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 28, 30. We do not ſay it can be underſtood of all theſe, as our Brethren ſeem to hint out of a fondneſs to find a contradiction in mee: not of <hi>Alms,</hi> and <hi>office</hi> too, this is but a childiſh reply of theirs in their firſt anſwer to my firſt objection. p. 35. of their book, it is enough for us if it be underſtood of one of theſe. For if I underſtand any thing of ſenſe or reaſon, thoſe who affirm this text to be a precept for the exerciſe of preaching gifts (as our Brethren do) muſt prove either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That that gift is ſpecially meant here,</hi> or, Secondly</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the precept is general, and not to be limited to this or that gift, but underſtood in the latitude of any gift to be improved for the good of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now which of theſe our Brethren will ſtand to by their anſwer, I cannot learn; for one while they tell us the next words are <hi>Exegetical</hi> of the former, <hi>another while</hi> they tell us <hi>Preaching</hi> is one of thoſe gifts. But let them take which they pleaſe. Is this then our Brethrens ſenſe, That the import of that text is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is the duty of any one who hath received any gift</hi> [that is <hi>any ability</hi> to do good to his brother] <hi>ſhould do it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Why then p. 32, 33. do our Brethren come in with their [i. e. <hi>Spirituul gift</hi>] by the ſame rule they reſtrain the text to <hi>ſpiritual gifts,</hi> we reſtrain it to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118929:45"/> 
               <hi>Office,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. Or to <hi>outward good things,</hi> the word is ſo uſed in Scripture; the Context is as much for us as for our Brethren: <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one to another,</hi> &amp; that is out of queſtion meant <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>If any man minister, let him do it of the ability God giveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But this ſay our Brethren, is not the</hi> manifold grace of God; Charity is but one Grace,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though Charity be but one grace, yet there be manifold Free gifts of God, by the diſtribution of which we may exerciſe Charity: The gift of Miracles was but one gift, yet <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. you have <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, various or manifold miracles. The body of <hi>luſt</hi> is but one body of death, yet there are many <hi>luſts,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. A man may miniſter from the grace of charity, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving money, meat, cloaths, &amp;c. and every one of theſe is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a free gift of God to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If any one who hath <hi>ability</hi> may diſpenſe the gift, then gifted. Brethren may <hi>adminiſter Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper too</hi> (by vertue of this Text) for there is no doubt but many of them have an ability to do all that which is to be done materially in thoſe acts; but this our Brethren will not allow: And why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are Acts of Office (ſay our Brethren) ſo ſay we is the <hi>Preaching</hi> we contend about. Our Brethren may ſee by this, a neceſſity of reſtraining this Text: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as we contend,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſuch Gifts as other Scriptures authorize them to adminiſter:</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To an Adminiſtration of this Gift,</hi> according to due Goſpel Order, which (we ſay) cannot be without preceding Ordination.</p>
            <q>Will our Brethren take the Second, and ſay, That <hi>an ability to Preach,</hi> is the <hi>Gift here only meant:</hi> and this Text will warrant a Miniſtring of that gift without any more ado?</q>
            <p n="1">1. Then we ask them by <hi>what authority they impoſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118929:45"/> this upon us; why may it not</hi> as well be expounded by the words <hi>immediatly going before,</hi> as thoſe immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after? then the Gift is the <hi>good things of this world:</hi> The ſenſe of the coherence will not conſtrain this interpretation, it makes as much for us, as it doth for them, nay more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the next words limit him that ſpeaks, to a ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the <hi>Oracles of God;</hi> but he who never had the <hi>Oracles of God committed to him,</hi> is not like to ſpeak the word <hi>as the Oracles of God;</hi> he may ſpeak the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God,</hi> but he cannot ſpeak them <hi>as the Oracles of God,</hi> becauſe not ſent by God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſe we ſhould allow this, that the Gift of opening and applying Scripture is here meant, <hi>How doth this Text prove, either a Liberty for, or a duty to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> this in publike Aſſemblies?</hi> otherwiſe our Brethren know we allow it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, to whom doth <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeak this? read <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>To the ſtrangers ſcattered through Aſia, Pontus, Galatia, Capadocia, Bythinia.</hi> Our diſpute is not, what may be Lawfully done in the <hi>ſcattred ſtate</hi> of the Church, where no Miniſters are at hand, but what may be done in ordinary Caſes, to which this Scripture ſpeaks nothing (If it be ſo to be underſtood) we do not doubt but in ſuch a perſecuted ſtate of the Church, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon Gifted may Preach, and people ought to hear, as well as the <hi>Levites</hi> might <hi>kill the Paſchal Lamb</hi> at <hi>Hezekiahs paſſeover:</hi> but (bleſſed be God) that's not our Caſe. Thus the Reader may ſee how inconcluſive our Brethrens Argument is from this Text, upon more accounts than one.</p>
            <q>Our Brethren have entred exceptions againſt two material things which we inſiſt upon, for the interpretation of this Text.</q>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Againſt what we ſay, that if this Text may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Gift of Preaching or Speaking, yet it may be done privately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:118929:46"/>2. Againſt what we ſay, <hi>That by Gift, very probably is meant Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us conſider what our Brethren ſay to either of theſe.</p>
            <q>They ſay firſt, that <hi>private exerciſing</hi> cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <hi>this precept,</hi> nor can this <hi>exerciſe</hi> be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo limited.</q>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe as a Church member, he may admoniſh and exhort ſeverally, and then why not when they are met together?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe a publike Gift, cannot be fully impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a private way: A man in ſuch a caſe hideth his talent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Publike actings are not peculiar to Office, they ſay.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Charity binds men ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>metimes to go out of their callings to help others.</p>
               <p>Therefore our Brethren may ſometimes ſtep out of their Calling to Preach.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A man may lawfully chooſe it for his calling to preach. And then he goeth not out of his Calling.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>"They have a Divine allowance,</hi> Heb. 10.25. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go not out of their Callings.</p>
               <p>"This is the ſumm of what they ſay to the firſt, <hi>à p.</hi> 46. <hi>ad p.</hi> 56. To all which I anſwer.</p>
            </q>
            <p n="1">1. We will not contend with our Brethren, that it is unlawfull for a private gifted perſon to ſpeak in the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Aſſemblies of the Church,</hi> provided it be not on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> which ought to be ſpent in peoples attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon <hi>publike Ordinances,</hi> of which nature their Preaching cannot be: but we deny, that any are bound to <hi>hear them,</hi> or that any can come to <hi>hear them</hi> as unto that <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Preaching, which lyes under the great <hi>appointment of God,</hi> to ſave peoples ſouls. And we ſay, the Church of God hath had no ſuch cuſtom.</p>
            <p>As to the Second, We do not underſtand our Brethrens
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118929:46"/> notion of a <hi>publick Gift,</hi> it may be taken in a double ſenſe. 1. <hi>For a Gift which God hath given to men, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to uſe it publikely.</hi> 2. For a Gift which <hi>if uſed publikely might be of publike ſervice.</hi> If our Brethren underſtand it in the firſt ſenſe, we deny any not ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have any ſuch publike Gift: if (as they muſt) they underſtand it in the latter ſenſe, we ſay it may be ſo far improved as to free men from ſin, in not improving it, without publike exerciſe: How many hundred men in <hi>England,</hi> have gifts for the Magiſtracy, that might be of publike uſe (were they ſo employed) yet I hope our Brethren will not bring this Text, to prove that they ought to adminiſter Judgement publikely: Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath required another Order, and a ſpecial regular Call for the exerciſe of thoſe publike Gifts; and we ſay the like for the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>To the Third, We grant that <hi>all publike a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ings are not peculiar to Office;</hi> but we ſay, the adminiſtration of <hi>publike Ordinances,</hi> is peculiar to publike Officers; and t is ſcarce ſenſe, to ſay a private perſon may adminiſter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>publike Ordinance,</hi>

            <p>To the Fourth, we ſay, That we grant that <hi>Charity may binde men to go out of their Callings to help another,</hi> and ſo Charity may binde a gifted man to Preach, in caſe of neceſſity; but this is not <hi>Ordinary preaching,</hi> of which the queſtion is ſtated.</p>
            <p>To the Fifth, We grant a private perſon may <hi>chooſe preaching for his Calling,</hi> but his <hi>chooſing</hi> of it doth not make that his Calling: the Church, ſay our Brethren, muſt chooſe him too, he muſt be ordained (ſay we.)</p>
            <p>To the Sixth, Our Brethren ſay, they have a divine allowance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. But to do what? Is it ſaid to Preach <hi>publikely</hi> and <hi>ordinarily?</hi> But let our Brethren prove that precept to be given to meer Gifted men; they indeed muſt not <hi>forſake aſſembling together:</hi> but is it not enough if their Officers only exhort? however our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

                  <hi>CHAP.

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>OUR Brethren in their Sixth Chapter, produce three Arguments, to prove the Lawfulneſs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Preaching (if Gifted) though not Ordained. Their firſt is this.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Preacher ſent, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.</note>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>That practice which hath a Goſpel Promiſe annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is warrantable.</p>
               <p>But the Preaching of ſome ſuch, hath a Goſpel Promiſe annexed: </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> we grant, the <hi>Minor</hi> we deny. They prove it from <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For unto every one that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us put it into Form.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>What the Goſpel promiſeth unto him that</hi> hath a talent, <hi>i. e. that improves it,</hi> That it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to Gifted mens Preaching without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</q>
            <p>Here's enough: Let me have the ſame Liberty, and our Brethren will quickly ſee the vanity of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:118929:48"/>
               <p>What the Gospel promiſeth to him that hath a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>i. e.</hi> that improves his talent; that it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to every one that will (having a gift of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juſtice) execute juſtice, though not any other way called to it than by his gifts. <hi>But the Goſpel promiſeth, &amp;c. Or thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What the Goſpel promiſeth to him that hath a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or ability, <hi>i. e.</hi> that by practice improves it, that it promiſeth to gifted perſons that have ability to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize and adminiſter the Supper, and will do it without any other authority than what their gifts give them. Therefore gifted men, not Commiſſionated for the Magiſtracy, nor ordained to the Miniſtry, may execute juſtice, and adminiſter Sacraments.</p>
            </q>
            <p> I believe my Lord <hi>Protector</hi> will hardly allow the firſt, and I think our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will not allow the latter; and when our Brethren have found out a diſtinction to help themſelves, we hope it will help us. Our Brethren, <hi>pag.</hi> 63. ſay plainly, <hi>they reſtrain not the Text to preaching Gifts.</hi> But they muſt do it, or elſe our Arguments from it are as good as theirs: and if they do reſtrain it, we ſhall hardly reſt in their ſenſe without good reaſon to juſtifie their reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this is enough for their third Argument, to which the ſame anſwer may be applied which was given before, to that drawn from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee if they be more happy at a fourth.</p>
            <p>Their fourth Argument is drawn <hi>from Goſpel Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> thus formed.<note place="margin">The Preacher ſent, or preaching without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, <hi>p.</hi> 66.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is holden forth by Gospel Preſidents with Divine allowance may be practiſed. But the ordinary exerciſe of preaching Gifts in publick Aſſemblies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Is ſo holden forth.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>I can neither allow the <hi>Major</hi> nor the <hi>Minor:</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow the <hi>Major</hi> (in the terms our Brethren have put it) for they might as well aſſume.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> or an <hi>univerſal inspection and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118929:49"/> of all Churches,</hi> is holden forth by Goſpel Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> Therefore we may have <hi>Popes, Archbiſhops,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Or thus,
<q>But the Holy kiſs, and anointing with oyl, are held forth by Gospel Preſidents with divine allowance. <hi>Ergo, Mr.</hi> Tilham, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Pooly <hi>are in the right.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If our Brethren underſtand the <hi>Major thus</hi> (I ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> allow it.)</p>
            <q>What is holden forth by Gospel Preſidents, to be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Caſes a ſtanding practice, may be lawfully practiſed.</q>
            <p>Then we deny the Aſſumption, <hi>viz. That the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gifted perſons</hi> (in the ſenſe before expreſſed) <hi>is by any Gospel Preſidents held forth as a ſtanding practice to be continued in the Church of Chriſt.</hi> Our Brethren prove it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the inſtance of <hi>Apollo,</hi> upon which they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant <hi>à</hi> p. 66. <hi>ad</hi> p. 73.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the inſtance of the <hi>ſcattered Saints,</hi> Acts 8. &amp; 11. upon which they deſcant <hi>ad</hi> p. 88. It muſt be granted, that the Scriptures ſay, that <hi>Apollo</hi> ſpake, and <hi>taught diligently,</hi> Acts 11.24, 25. and that ſome of the ſcattered brethren <hi>preached.</hi> But to anſwer all in ſhort, Every underſtanding Reader will grant, the Argument being <hi>ab exemplo pari,</hi> If theſe examples prove not <hi>(paria)</hi> matches, the Argument falls to the ground: If either there were not a <hi>parity of ſpecies,</hi> in their gifts, or in their <hi>acts,</hi> or not a <hi>parity,</hi> in the ſtate of the Church at that time, with that which is the preſent ſtate of it; now we ſay, that in ſome, if not in all theſe their argument from hence halteth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I ſay, there muſt <hi>be a parity in the species of their gifts:</hi> for I hope our brethren have no deſign to put this fallacy upon their Readers; <hi>if thoſe who were furniſhed with the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118929:49"/> ſuited to the firſt plantation of the Church, might preach, then thoſe who have but very ordinary gifts, according to the ſize of theſe times, and the opportunities of that little leiſure they could get from their Trades, may do the like;</hi> this were juſt ſuch an Argument, as if one ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that becauſe one who had the gifts of healing, might go to a ſick perſon, and anoint <hi>him with oyl,</hi> and lay <hi>hands on him,</hi> and pray, and by a <hi>faith of miracles,</hi> believe he ſhould upon this recover; therefore one may do ſo now: So that if it appear that <hi>Apollo,</hi> or thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> 8. or 11. had gifts of another ſpecies; either <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> or <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, which all grant to be now ceaſed, our brethrens Argument ſinks. Now let us examine the inſtances by this rule, Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which our brethren have been told concerning <hi>Apollo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>That he is ranked with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. called a Miniſter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>That it is very probable his gifts were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>species,</hi> from that which our gifted men now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days have; it is ſaid he was mighty in the Scriptures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our brethren ſay nothing to this: <hi>but let thoſe who ſay it prove it;</hi> but as I take it they aſſert, and ſhould prove; however we have proved, that he is <hi>called a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> and ranked with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> But ſay our brethren, this was <hi>afterward.</hi> A very little time it ſeems; for the Text ſaith, he went ſoon into <hi>Achaia;</hi> and in the firſt verſe of the next chapter, <hi>he is reported in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> So that it is plain that he preached only <hi>in order to Office,</hi> that <hi>he might be proved;</hi> in which caſe our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren know we allow preaching <hi>ex dono.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly, for the <hi>ſcattered Chriſtians,</hi> they have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> been told,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>That it is the opinion of ſome, theſe were ſome of the 70. whoſe Office-gift was of another ſpecies, being an extraordinary Miſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:118929:50"/>2. <q>That the Sctipture ſaith expreſly of one of theſe, <hi>Philip,</hi> he was an Evangeliſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.8. and he is the only Preacher named.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. "That thoſe were members of the <hi>Church of Jeruſalem,</hi> ſome of the 8000. who were filled with the extraordinary gifts <hi>of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and might ſpeak <hi>the word with boldneſs,</hi> Acts 4.31. If our brethren have any indued with gifts of that <hi>species,</hi> God forbid we ſhould deny them liberty; but we conceive them ceaſed, and with them the ſtrength of this Argument too.</p>
            <p>Now what ſay our brethren to take off theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers?</p>
            <p>I ſhall not meddle with what they ſay to the firſt; it being an anſwer not to be reſted upon, and ſupernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary. As to the ſecond, they tell us <hi>p.</hi> 81. <hi>The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is feeble, becauſe one was an Officer:</hi> Ergo, <hi>all were.</hi> It is an eaſie thing our brethren know to break a mans legs, and then ſay he is lame: This Argument was not brought as <hi>demonſtrative,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 81.</note> but as a good <hi>topick;</hi> but the ſtrength lay here, <hi>Every one of them whom the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture names was an Officer;</hi> and therefore it is not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> any preached but Officers, and what ever Office <hi>Philip</hi> was <hi>ordained</hi> to, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. certain it is he was an <hi>Officer,</hi> and ſo our brethren grant. As to the laſt Anſwer (which alone is ſufficient) they have ſaid nothing. So then upon this enquiry, our brethrens Argument lyes thus.</p>
            <q>If <hi>Apollo</hi> who was ſoon after to be made an Officer of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> preached in order to Ordination, and ſome ſcattered Members of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who had received the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt preached, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom <hi>(we think)</hi> there were ſome no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, then private perſons, who have but very ordinary gifts, and intend no ſuch Ordination, may preach too.</q>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:118929:50"/>
            <p>To which we muſt crave leave to anſwer. —<hi>Non ſequitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Brethrens Argument is ſick of more <hi>Non ſequiturs</hi> than one. To proceed therefore.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In caſe there were no parity in their <hi>acts,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> then our Brethrens Argument is naught, for I hope our brethren have no deſign to ſerve us with ſuch a fallacy as this. <hi>If the ſcattered Chriſtians, wherever they became in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſes commended the Gospel to people, then gifted men may in the publick Aſſemblies of the Church, or any people, perform that Ordinance of Chriſt called preaching.</hi> That were juſt ſuch an Argument as this. If <hi>John a Nokes</hi> may turn a ſervant out of communion with his Family, then he may excommunicate him out of the <hi>Church.</hi> Our Brethren in that Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. have found the word <hi>preach;</hi> but nothing to evidence it was in <hi>publick Aſſemblies,</hi> nor will Gods bleſſing their labours prove it; God may, and oft doth bleſs private means when publick cannot be had. The caſe was otherwiſe indeed concerning <hi>Apollo,</hi> it is ſaid, he preached in the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues;</hi> but ſo might any one, according to the corrupt ſtate of the Jewiſh Church at that time; and beſides (as I ſaid before) he was to be proved in order to <hi>office,</hi> which our Brethren grant he afterward had.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, There muſt be a <hi>parity in the State of the Church</hi> too, or elſe their Argument will not hold: but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this there is not. 1. <hi>It was an infant ſtate,</hi> and is is a true obſervation of <hi>Didoclavius,</hi> that many things may be lawfull in the <hi>infancy</hi> of a Church, which are not to be <hi>imitated</hi> nor <hi>induced</hi> in a ſetled Church. 2. <hi>It was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted State.</hi> This is indeed the beſt anſwer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Brethren ſpend moſt pains in trying to anſwer it, <hi>pag.</hi> 85, 86, 87, 88. Let us conſider what they ſay.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They grant that neceſſity may legitimate an action otherwiſe not lawfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:118929:51"/>2. <q>
                  <hi>They ſay, though</hi> they were neceſſitated to traevel, yet they were not neceſſitated to preach.</q> What do our brethren think we mean by neceſſity? or how comes neceſſity into the queſtion, <hi>which is whether it be not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for private perſons to do ſomething in a perſecuted State of the Church, which is not lawfull in a ſetled ſtate of it?</hi> But to take our Brethren at their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neceſſe eſt quod nec eſſe aliter poteſt;</hi> there is a <hi>natural neceſſity,</hi> and there is a <hi>moral neceſſity:</hi> We never thought this neceſſity was <hi>natural;</hi> and yet againſt that our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren argue. There is an <hi>abſolute neceſſity,</hi> and an <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical neceſſity.</hi> In ſhort, we ſay, they might be under a manifold neceſſity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A neceſſity of the <hi>precept;</hi> they were <hi>filled with the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and thoſe extraordinary gifts might be attended with an extraordinary praeceptive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.31.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There was <hi>neceſſit as medii;</hi> there was no other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means of ſalvation for thoſe people where they came, than that extraordinary courſe of theirs, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles being yet left at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Upon this ſuppoſition, that it was the will of God his Goſpel ſhould at that time be made known to thoſe people, it was neceſſary; for there were no others in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our Brethren queſtion whether neceſſity can legitimate an action, in it ſelf unlawfull: <hi>but grant,</hi> it may legitimate an action unlawfull at this or that time.</q> Not to diſpute the firſt, which yet we might by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours inſtance of the <hi>Shew-bread</hi> taken by <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. The later part granted, is enough for us, if our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren mean ingenuouſly: We do not ſay it is againſt the light of nature to preach without Ordination.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>But it is unlawfull at ſuch a time when the Church hath plenty of Miniſters, and there is no need of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118929:51"/> their extraordinary actings, being calm and ſetled.</hi> Now that which is unlawfull at ſuch and ſuch a time, our Brethren grant neceſſity may make lawfull; we ask no more at their hands at this time.</q>
            <p n="3">3. <q>Our Brethren enquire when is there ſuch a caſe of neceſſity? and conclude, when Ordination cannot be had in Gods way.—And they can finde no lawfull Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation without a preceding election to a particular Church: And therefore all Gifted men lye under ſuch a neceſſity.</q> Let us put this looſe diſcourſe into form; It muſt be thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If Gifted men may Preach in a caſe of neceſſity, and it be a caſe of neceſſity when they cannot have Ordination in Gods way, and this cannot be till they be choſen Officers to a particular Church, then till that time their Preaching is juſtified by neceſſity.</hi> But, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our brethren know, that although they ſay they cannot, yet we can ſee regular Ordination, without a Call to a particular Church; we are at a loſs to know what election to a particular Church preceded the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> of <hi>Timothy,</hi> of any one preaching Elder in Scripture.—Our Brethren go on.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>They that preach in ſuch caſes of neceſsity, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> officers, or no officers. If no officers, then preaching is not a peculiar act of office; then there is a difference betwixt Preaching by Office and by Gift.—<hi>If they be Officers, then</hi> Ordination is not eſſential to office: Then another Miſſion muſt be found out beſides Ordination; then Baptiſm is valid without Ordination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To anſwer to all this. Thoſe who preach in ſuch Caſes of neceſſity, where people can have no ordained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to hear, may be ſaid to, Preach by an extraordinary <hi>authority,</hi> which the word of the Lord hath in ſuch caſes given them, which may be called a Miſsion, and they may be Officers, as to that time, and ſtate; yet it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118929:52"/> will not follow but in another <hi>ſtate of the Church</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is eſſential to an <hi>ordinary Miniſter,</hi> that is, to one who according to the Rule of Chriſt in ordinary caſes <hi>ought to preach.</hi> All this arguing is nothing to the purpoſe: for our brethren are to prove, that <hi>Gifted men may ordinarily preach</hi> in a tranquil, and ſetled ſtate of the Church, where are Miniſters Ordained enough to ſupply the place, or at leaſt to ordain and authorize them. Their Argument <hi>à pari</hi> here, is no Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the diſparity of the Churches State. If our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren can bring us any Texts out of the Epiſtles wrote to ſetled Churches, requiring, commanding, or allowing ſuch a practice for perſons not in office, nor furniſhed with extraordinary gifts to preach publickly, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, they ſay ſomething; all this is no better than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or go round about the buſh, but never ſtrike one blow at it.</p>
            <p>I come therefore to their fifth Argument, p. 88.</p>
            <q>
               <p>All that are Prophets may publickly (they ſhould have put in ordinarily too) preach.</p>
               <p>But ſome men <hi>[they ſhould have ſaid ſome ſuch Gifted men as we have now]</hi> who are not ordained Officers, are Prophets; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>If our Brethren will not allow my correction of their Propoſitions, I will deny the Concluſion, <hi>becauſe the queſtion is not in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they will allow my corrections, I deny their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and ſay,
<q>No ſuch Gifted men as now live <hi>(for whom our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren muſt plead)</hi> are Prophets.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They prove it, p. 89. <hi>All that have the gifts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, are Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>But ſome ſuch Gifted men as are now to be found have the gift of prophecie; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> I grant; The <hi>Minor</hi> I deny.</p>
            <p>Three things our Brethren undertake to prove; p. 90.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:118929:52"/>
               <item>1. <hi>That prophecie is a Gift, not an Office.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That ſome have the gift of prophecie, and that gift ſtill continueth.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>That ſome perſons not ordained have it.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I ſhall only premiſe this, that I hope our Brethren un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by <hi>prophecie,</hi> ſuch <hi>prophecie</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> otherwiſe they deceive their Reader with an <hi>equivocal word;</hi> and then I deny all three of their Poſitions, and ſhall proceed to examine their proof of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That prophecie is a gift, not an office,</hi> they prove,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe there is no Scripture-warrant to ordain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe they cannot be ordained, till they be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have the gift of prophecie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe ſome have this gift, who are no officers.</hi> This laſt I deny, they pretend to prove it hereafter.</p>
            <p>As to the two firſt, our Brethren diſpute <hi>ex ignoratione Elenchi,</hi> againſt what none deny; who ever ſaid thoſe Prophets were ordinary Officers? We ſay they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers, who were furniſhed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gift, <hi>either to foretell things to come, or elſe to interpret Scripture by an infallible Spirit, without the uſe of ſuch means as we now muſt uſe;</hi> and being thus furniſhed, were made Officers at that time by an <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Miſſion,</hi> to which Ordination was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p>So then two things we inſiſt upon. 1. That Prophets were <hi>extraordinary Officers.</hi> 2. <hi>That their gift was an extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The firſt is enough for this place: That they were <hi>officers,</hi> appears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2. And that they were <hi>extraordinary,</hi> appears in that they are ſet before Evangeliſts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. and from their extraordinary gifts, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.27, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10, 11. and from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. from which text it is plain, that they ſpake
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118929:53"/> from <hi>revelation,</hi> this hath been told our Brethren both by our reverend Brethren of <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                     </gap>ii,</hi> p. 50, 51, &amp;c.</note> &amp; by my ſelf. Now for our Brethren to argue againſt this, becauſe <hi>they were not ordained,</hi> is a pitifull <hi>Non ſequitur;</hi> for none ever ſaid <hi>Ordination</hi> was neceſſary to the conſtitution of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi> or any <hi>extraordinary</hi> Officer.</p>
            <q>But our Brethren judge that they can prove, that prophecying was not an office, but a gift, <hi>p. 90. And this they endeavour by two Arguments, p. 91. &amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Their firſt Argument in form is this,
<q>
                  <p>If all who have the gift of prophecie are Prophets, then prophecie is a gift, not an office.</p>
                  <p>But all who have the gift of prophecie are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We deny the Conſequence, and ſay our Brethren have not proved it; for this it all they ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <q>They muſt firſt have the gift before they can be made Prophets.</q> We deny that. God in the ſame moment clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed them with an extraordinary Authority, &amp; furniſhed them with an extraordinary <hi>gift.</hi> So he did <hi>Jeremy, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> and all the Prophets of old. I wonder which of them could be ſaid to have the <hi>Gift of prophecie one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> before they were Prophets by Office too? this is ſtill a fallacy <hi>ab ignoratione Elenchi;</hi> to extraordinary Officers, no ſuch thing was needfull.</p>
            <p>Our brethrens ſecond Argument is this,
<q>
                  <p>That which ought in duty, and might in faith be coveted by every member of the Church in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> was a gift only, not an office.</p>
                  <p>But Prophecying might ſo be coveted; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Before I give a direct anſwer to the Argument, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>prophecying</hi> (to ſpeak properly) to be neither a <hi>gift</hi> nor <hi>office,</hi> but an act by which either is exerciſed, which act we ſay none could exerciſe, but he who had the <hi>gift</hi> for it, and alſo the extraordinary authority
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118929:53"/> which impowred him to it; and that <hi>prophecying</hi> is in no ſenſe to be called a gift, but as an <hi>office</hi> is a <hi>gift,</hi> being conſtituted for the good of the Church, and an honour to them that have it. But to ſpeak to their Argument.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I deny the <hi>Major. That which ought in thoſe times to be coveted, and might in faith have been coveted by every member of the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>might be an extraordinary office.</hi> But ſay our Brethren.</p>
            <q>The Lord had no where promiſed to make every member of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> a Church officer, therefore it could not be an office.</q>
            <p n="1">1. Our Brethren did not conſider, that the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will prove it was no gift, except they can ſhew us where the Lord had promiſed to give every member of the Church the gift of prophecie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29. Are all Prophets? The Lord no where promiſed to give all Chriſtians a <hi>power to work miracles,</hi> or to ſpeak with tongues, yet ſurely, they might covet it, as it is plain from the next words, where though prophecying be preferred before tongues, yet that is left upon record as one of thoſe gifts might be coveted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath no where promiſed that <hi>John a Stiles</hi> ſhould recover of his ſickneſs; doth it therefore follow he cannot <hi>pray in Faith?</hi> We uſe to teach our People, that our prayers for things not neceſſary to ſalvation, ſhould be prayed for with ſubmiſsion to Gods will, and the prayer is in Faith, while he that prays believes, God will do that which is moſt good for him; ſo might every member of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> pray for a gift, that he might be able to propheſie; but he ought to regulate his deſires with a ſubmiſſion to the will, and wiſdom of God; and doing ſo he might pray in <hi>faith,</hi> though there were no ſuch particular promiſe.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſay our Brethren, this was impoſſible to be obtained, <bibl>
                     <hi>1 Cor. 12.17.</hi>
                  </bibl>
               </p>
               <p>If the whole body were an eye, where would hearing be?</p>
            </q>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:118929:54"/>
            <p>If I ſhould tell our Brethren here, <hi>To God nothing is impoſſible,</hi> they would think I equivocated with them, yet it is the coyn they have much uſed in payment to me; but where lyes the impoſſibility, in reſpect of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will? they inſtance in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 22.17. <hi>If the whole body were an eye, where would hearing be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Text indeed proves, that all the Members of a particular Church, cannot be officers to that Church (and we wiſh our Brethren would think of that Text, who gave leave to any of their members to be <hi>tongues</hi> to ſpeak the word, <hi>ears</hi> to hear, and <hi>heads</hi> to govern, whiles they order all affairs by common ſuffrage) But ſurely it will not follow, but that all thoſe who are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in this particular Church, may yet be in time Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to other Churches, there is no impoſsibility in this at all: yea and they ought to labour after ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>Beſides, univerſal holineſs (our Brethren know) may and ought to be laboured for, yet <hi>it is not promiſed,</hi> nor can be attained.</p>
            <p>We allow alſo that Text, to prove that <hi>all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the univerſal Church,</hi> ſhould not be ordinary Officers.</p>
            <p>But it doth not prove an impoſsibility of their being <hi>extraordinary officers:</hi> Much leſs doth any thing they have ſaid, prove that all Chriſtians in that Church, might not labour for ſuch gifts as might make them fit to do an act of office, when God ſhould ſet them in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Neither can I underſtand the <hi>harſhneſs of the ſound,</hi> which our Brethren hint, <hi>pag.</hi> 92. That it ſhould be the duty of every private Chriſtian to pray for ſuch a proportion of gifts, as (if God pleaſed ſo to imploy him) he might alſo be able to interpret Scriptures by an <hi>uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Spirit,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak with tongues,</hi> or be able to heal the ſick, provided his End were right in deſiring. For theſe were peculiar favours that God had promiſed by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118929:54"/> 
               <hi>Joel,</hi> and was giving out in that Age. Surely what the Apoſtle <hi>might wiſh for, them they might pray for:</hi> but 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.5. <hi>I would that you all ſpake with tongues.</hi> They proceed to the proof of the <hi>Minor:</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That the prophecying ſpoken of, ought in duty, and might in faith be coveted by every man in the Church of <hi>Corinth; this they prove from the terms,</hi> ye, <hi>and</hi> all, v. <hi>1.</hi> v. <hi>5. To which I anſwer:</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Having denyed the <hi>Major,</hi> and made good our denial of it: I need not trouble my ſelf with denying this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Brethren alſo know the term <hi>all</hi> doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude every individual always. <hi>Are all Prophets?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29. Let us hear what they ſay to our Arguments, to prove that theſe prophets were Officers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We argued from two Texts of Scriptures,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Where they ſtand diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the people, and enumerated amongſt officers, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before Evangeliſts, and next to the Apoſtles.</hi> To this they anſwer, <hi>p.</hi> 93, 94, 95.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>"That priority of order is no infallible Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>"That ſome not Officers are enumerated,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. and prophecie is called a gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <q>Thoſe texts might be meant of extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>ſuch as</hi> Acts <hi>11.27, 28.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I ſhall give a ſhort anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We grant <hi>priority of order</hi> is no infallible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, where there is any other Scripture, or any ſound reaſon to evince it no intention of the holy Pen-men, to expreſs the Order; but we ſay our brethren have no ſuch Text, nor reaſon neither, and that the Apoſtle in that Text, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. ſeems to rank <hi>Preaching Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi> according to their dignity, beginning with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> then reckoning <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Paſtors,</hi> Fifthly, <hi>Teachers:</hi> And verſe 12. To <hi>diſtinguiſh them from ordinary Saints,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118929:55"/> and the common Members of the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſay, there are none but Officers mentioned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. Nor any, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29. But ſuch as were either <hi>officers,</hi> or <hi>gifted with extraordinary Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> from whence we conclude, That <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were either extraordinary officers,</hi> or <hi>ordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> or gifted with <hi>extraordinary gifts (peculiar to that ſtate of the Church.)</hi> Now it is indifferent to us (as to the preſent controverſie) of which it be underſtood; So our Brethren will grant, that one of them muſt be meant, and ſo much that Text will evince. <hi>If Gifted men</hi> be meant, I wonder who are the <hi>Church</hi> in which they are ſet? <hi>ver.</hi> 29. Our Brethren ſay, <hi>prophecie</hi> is called a <hi>Gift,</hi> Rom. 12.6. but there is nothing plainer, than that by <hi>gift,</hi> is meant <hi>office,</hi> to him that readeth <hi>ver.</hi> 7.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas our Brethren ſay thoſe Texts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. may be meant of <hi>extraordinary prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 96.</note> we take them at their word; and ſay it is all we have been contending for; only then it lies upon our brethren to prove, that the <hi>prophets</hi> ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. are not the ſame ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. we appeal to every judicious Chriſtian to judge in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>In the next place our Brethren undertake to prove it <hi>a gift ſtill continuing in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe there is no Goſpel Rule for the ceaſing of it:</hi> So ſay the <hi>Prelates</hi> for <hi>Arch-biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops;</hi> where is the rule for the ceaſing of their Office? We ſay the Apoſtles giving Rules for the ordaining <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> in Churches, and committing government to them, was enough, and the ceſſation of their <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miſſion</hi> was enough. So we ſay for theſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> the ceſſation of the Gift manifeſted by obvious experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is a demonſtration to us that <hi>prophecie</hi> is ceaſed, where is there any now that can without ſtudy and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, infallibly give the ſenſe of Scriptures, from <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> or can <hi>foretell things to come?</hi> we have pitifull
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118929:55"/> experience every day that thoſe pleaded for cannot do the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the year 1657. being come and gone, and the Jews not converted, proves that <hi>John Tillinghaſt</hi> (though as famous and able as any our Brethren plead for) prove they cannot do the <hi>later.</hi> As we ſay to the <hi>Prelatical party,</hi> ſo we ſay to our Brethren, St. <hi>Pauls</hi> charging <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>ſtudy</hi> and <hi>meditate,</hi> &amp;c. was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proof, that this prophecying is ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, "Our Brethren ſay it was an <hi>ordinary gift,</hi> and <hi>therefore it continues;</hi> the gift of tongues, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe days were ordinary, yet none of them is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, I hope.</p>
            <p>What elſe our Brethren mean by <hi>ordinary,</hi> I cannot tell; for if they mean it was given by God for a <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance,</hi> it is yet to be proved; for this they refer us to Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> (a man whom I honour, but am not of his minde in this thing.) It was indeed his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Apoſtle by <hi>prophecying,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1. means no other <hi>than the ordinary acts of Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> though from an <hi>extraordinary principle and faculty;</hi> ſo that ſtill he thought, <hi>the gift was extraordinary,</hi> which they by their <hi>prophecying</hi> did exerciſe. For thoſe eight particulars inſtanced in by Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> recited by our brethren, p. 99, 100. we ſay they were no other than <hi>rules of order,</hi> which extraordinary officers, as well as ordinary were to be limited by. But I wonder our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſhould quote Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and ſet down his words too, which plainly ſay, he thought the <hi>gift ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> though their <hi>acts</hi> were but the <hi>acts of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers.</hi> Theſe are his words as quoted by our Brethren.</p>
            <q>Only the internal principle, to wit the infuſed gift of prophecying, made them extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>in fieri,</hi> as our prophets become prophets <hi>in fieri</hi> by ordinary ſtudies and induſtry; but in <hi>facto eſſe,</hi> and according to the ſubſtance of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118929:56"/> the acts of prophecying, theſe extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and our ordinary Paſtors differ not in ſpecie, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>Let any <hi>Reader,</hi> who underſtands <hi>Engliſh,</hi> judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> thought the <hi>Gift</hi> of prophecie was <hi>ordinary;</hi> he indeed thought the <hi>Act was,</hi> viz. That God in thoſe days by <hi>Revelation</hi> immediatly gifted the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his Goſpel in the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> but our brethren are to prove the <hi>Gift</hi> is ordinary; if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what they undertook, <hi>pag.</hi> 96. to prove which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> will do them no kindneſs: The faculty of ſeeing was in an extraordinary manner given to the <hi>blind man;</hi> and the converſion of the water into wine at <hi>Cana,</hi> John 2. (which are the two inſtances Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> inſiſts upon) were both <hi>extraordinary,</hi> though when the blind man had his <hi>viſive faculty</hi> by a Miracle conferred, his ſeeing was but ordinary as other men, and when the Wine was made, it taſted like other Wine.</p>
            <q>Our <hi>Brethren</hi> proceed ſtill with their fallacy of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Act</hi> to the <hi>Gift,</hi> or rather of putting in <hi>Act,</hi> where they ſhould have put in <hi>Gift,</hi> pag. 100.</q>
            <p n="1">1. And they again tell us the <hi>Rules to regulate the work are ordinary,</hi> what is this to prove the gift is ſo? the Act may be ordinary, and yet the <hi>Gift</hi> not ſo; as in the caſe of the <hi>blind man</hi> before mentioned. The work of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>officers</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> were to come under gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules of order, I hope.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But they tell us the deſcription <hi>of the work is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary:</hi> What if it be? The queſtion is what the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Gift</hi> would be: the deſcription of the <hi>Gift</hi> of ſeeing, and the Act of <hi>ſeeing</hi> are two things, I hope, ſo in this caſe; but where is that deſcription? They tell us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. <q>He that prophecyeth ſpeaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort.</q> Hete they tell us is the <hi>Act,</hi> Exhortation, 2. The Ends of it, <hi>exhortation</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:118929:56"/> and <hi>comfort.</hi> Surely our Brethren preſumed that none ſhould ever examine what they ſay; the Text is,</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>He that prophecyeth speaketh unto men edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and exhortation, and comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. (So far as it is a deſcription) It is a deſcription of the <hi>Act</hi> not of the <hi>gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Our Brethren if they had pleaſed, might as well have ſaid <hi>edification,</hi> or comfort was the <hi>Act,</hi> as they ſay <hi>exhortation</hi> is; for the Text proves the one as well as the other.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the Apoſtle by theſe words only expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the end of prophecying, and ſuch ends as were common to that, with other ordinances &amp; duties too. If I ſhould ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> working miracles <hi>confirmed the Goſpel f r the converſion of unbelievers;</hi> would it follow that the Act of <hi>working miracles</hi> was confirming the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>In the third place they tell us, <q>That one great end of extraordinary prophecying, and their main and proper act, <hi>viz.</hi> foretelling future events, is denyed to this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying:</q> This they ſay, but they have not told us where that <hi>denial</hi> is to be found, and I cannot find it. All that I can find them ſaying is this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22. It is ſaid, <hi>Tongues were for a ſign to them that believed not; but Prophecy ſerveth not for them who believe not, but for thoſe that believe.</hi> Hence they obſerve, That the <q>antitheſis <hi>betwixt</hi> Tongues and Prophets, that tongues were for a ſign, but not prophecie, proves, that prophecy could not be for a ſign.</q> But this is wofully fallacious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Antitheſis lyes not there,</hi> that <hi>Tongues were for a ſign, but prophecie not ſo:</hi> but here, That <hi>tongues were for a ſign to heathens that bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eved not; but prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying was a ſign only for ſuch as believed;</hi> viz. It was an act only to be performed within the pale of the Church; this text only proves, that prophecie was no ſign to them that believed not.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:118929:57"/>2. Though the <hi>foretelling of things to come,</hi> might bear the <hi>nature of a ſign;</hi> yet this was not the only end of it; but the faith, and holineſs of the perſons to whom the prophecie was directed; neither indeed could the foretelling of things to come <hi>confirm any thing to any,</hi> till they ſaw them accompliſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I conceive the chief act of thoſe Propheteſſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was their <hi>infallible interpretation of Scripture, by an extraordinary gift,</hi> which indeed to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not the Scriptures, would be of no uſe; but was to ſuch as did believe them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <q>Our Brethren ſay, Women Propheteſſes are forbidden to ſpeak in the Church, <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>14.34.</hi> But wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Propheteſſes might propheſie things to come, <hi>Luke 2.38.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer, that our Brethren do not find <hi>women pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſes</hi> mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. only <hi>women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, our Brethren do not finde that <hi>Anna, Luke</hi> 2.36. ſpake things to come; the Text only ſaith, <hi>She gave thanks unto the Lord, and ſpake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Iſrael:</hi> She ſpake of a Chriſt already born. She was called a <hi>Propheteſs</hi> (in all probability) becauſe of an extraordinary faculty ſhe had from <hi>Divine revelation to interpret Seripture:</hi> So that our Brethren ſee this kinde of publike prophecying (by their own inſtance) belonged to <hi>women;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by their own Argument was extraordinary. But the truth is, this Liberty was reſtrained by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37. But this is enough to ſhew the weakneſs of our Brethrens Argument.</p>
            <q>Our Brethren <hi>having</hi> ſpent their ſhot upon us, come at laſt to receive a <hi>volly</hi> from us; to prove prophecie an <hi>extraordinary gift,</hi> we had told our Brethren,</q>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>ver.</hi> 26. it was evident. When therefore you come together, <hi>every one of you hath a Pſalm, a doctrine,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118929:57"/> a revelation, an interpretation,</hi> (I have put in the word <hi>doctrine</hi> now, though I think it will not much ſerve our Brethrens turn.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> are mentioned with a <hi>note of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,</hi> denying it to be a gift common to all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 29, 30. <hi>Are all prophets?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>prophets</hi> in all the Old Teſtament, and new too, ſignified <hi>extraordinary officers,</hi> who acted from <hi>immediate revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That <hi>prophecie is reckoned up as one of the rareſt gifts the Apoſtles had,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.2. 1 Cor. 14.16. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before <hi>Tongues,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1, 2. <hi>Paul</hi> compared himſelf with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That it is diſtinguiſhed from the word of wiſdom and knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That it is ſaid prophecyes ſhall fail,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.8.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>That prophecying is ſaid not to ſerve for thoſe that believe not,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.22.</p>
            <p>To the firſt our Brethren anſwer, that we left out the word <hi>doctrine,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. The charge falls not on me, but now it is put in, let us ſee what our brethren get by it. The ſenſe of the text muſt be, <hi>Either that every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual member of the Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>had all theſe,</hi> and then they all had extraordinary gifts; for ſurely the gift of <hi>compoſing Pſalms,</hi> and the gift of <hi>Revelation,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be no ordinary gifts. If this be the ſenſe, the prophecying in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was by perſons extraordinarily gifted, infallibly inſpired, and ſo the Argument of our Brethren from their example fails, becauſe they argue <hi>à pari,</hi> where is no parity in the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Gifts. Or elſe the ſenſe muſt be, one of you hath a <hi>doctrine,</hi> another a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> another a <hi>Revelation,</hi> &amp;c. If this be the ſenſe, how do our Brethren prove, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> belonged to the <hi>prophets?</hi> Other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures quoted by our Brethren, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9. make labouring in Doctrine, the <hi>work of Paſtors and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118929:58"/> Teachers,</hi> &amp; if the Doctrine were the <hi>Paſtors</hi> &amp; <hi>Teachers</hi> part, either the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> or the <hi>Revelation</hi> muſt be the <hi>Prophets work;</hi> for the interpretation clearly belonged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o tongues, or at leaſt related to it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.13. 1 <hi>Cron.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hren take which they will, the <hi>Gift was extraordinary.</hi> Our Brethren ſay, that <hi>Revelation</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Prophecy,</hi> ver. 6. but they did not conſider that in the ſame words, it is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Doctrine too.</hi> What ſhall I profit you, except I ſhall ſpeak to you either by <hi>revelation, or by prophecying, or by doctrine?</hi> From whence we eaſily conclude, that the <hi>prophecying</hi> meant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was not <hi>speaking to people by doctrine,</hi> and yet this is the trade to which our Brethren would pretend a Freedom for their gifted Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſay our brethren, <hi>It may be meant of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary revelation,</hi> Eph. 1.16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let what revelation will be meant, <hi>It is not doctrine;</hi> theſe Prophets ſpake not by Doctrine, that was another thing, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Now I think <hi>preaching is a ſpeaking by Doctrine.</hi> And that is it to juſtifie which we ſay no proof can be produced from this Text.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We grant an <hi>ordinary revelation (ſano ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu)</hi> that is, That the Lord by his Spirit doth ordinarily give his people, in the uſe of due means, ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>of his written word, as is neceſſary for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> yea, <hi>as may be for their conſolation,</hi> that they may as to their own ſouls, <hi>know the hope of his Calling</hi> (as in that text, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. quoted by our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) and <hi>know their own grace, and right unto glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. That they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in their doubts, and come up to perfection in knowledge and holineſs. But all this as to their own private uſe. Let our Brethren bring us any ſhadow of Scripture, to prove that God hath promiſed ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to reveal unto his people ſuch a knowledge of the Scriptures, as they may publikely and ordinarily commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it in Church Aſſemblies.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:118929:58"/>Whereas we told them <hi>Prophets are mentioned with a note of ſingularity,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29, 30. they tell us ſo was the gift of Teaching, yet it is an ordinary office.</q>
            <p>Every Reader will conſider, that it was enough for us to prove, either that theſe Prophets were Officers, or that they had an extraordinary gift. It is true, the note of ſingularity affixed (or indeed the term of reſtriction affixed rather) will not prove the gift was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but it will prove that <hi>either the Prophets</hi> were Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or the <hi>gift was extraordinary;</hi> for no others are there enumerated, but extraordinary, or ordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or ſuch as had the <hi>extraordinary gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>To our third Allegation,</hi> That the title Prophets, and the term prophecying in all the Old Teſtament is peculiar to perſons that were extraordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and extraordinarily gifted, <hi>and</hi> generally <hi>ſo in the</hi> New Teſtament;</q>
            <p>Our Brethren anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>That they have given many Arguments to prove that in <hi>1 Cor. 14.</hi> neither Officers, nor perſons extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily gifted are meant; and that chapter speaking chiefly of Prophecie as the ſubject is moſt fit to interpret it.</q> But their ſeveral Reaſons being anſwered, no more need be added.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is queſtionable they ſay, whether in ſome of the places mentioned, the word prophecying be taken, either for an act of Office; or for an exerciſe of an extraordinary gift;</hi> and to this purpoſe they mention, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.57. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.41. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.32. To which I anſwer.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Brethren of <hi>London,</hi> p. 94. and my ſelf (from others) p. 50. did ſay, that we conceive, where ever <hi>Prophets or Prophecie are mentioned in Scripture, ſome extraordinary Gift or Office is underſtood.</hi> It had
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118929:59"/> been enough for us to have ſaid that <hi>generally</hi> it is ſo. But being the word is out, let it go, and let us examine the places our brethren have picked out to prove the contrary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For that Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Many ſhall ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, we have propheſied in thy name, and in thy name have we caſt out devils, and done many miracles:</hi> We grant, that it cannot be from hence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively proved, that the <hi>prophecying</hi> here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned was an <hi>extraordinary Gift;</hi> becauſe the other two things mentioned were; but we appeal to all the world, whether this be not a ſtrong preſumption on our ſide, and ſuch as our Brethren can never diſprove. For that text, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1. <hi>There were certain Prophets and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the Church at</hi> Antioch. Theſe were ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets as were <hi>joyned with Teachers.</hi> 2. <hi>Preferred before them,</hi> according to the order alſo uſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. 3. <hi>Such as the Spirit called to ordain</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas: Let any reaſonably judge, whether theſe can be thought the ordinary gifted men of that Church; for <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.11. <hi>John in a viſion took a little Book from the Angel, and did eat it</hi>—And then the Angel ſaid to him, <hi>Thou mayeſt propheſie again,</hi> &amp;c. Was this by vertue of ordinary gift think we? Their next is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.57. <hi>A prophet is not without honour, but in his own Country;</hi> this Rule they ſay, <hi>is true of all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Teachers.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. commands <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to watch in all things, to endure afflictions, to do the work of an Evangeliſt, and to make proof of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry;</hi> theſe things are the duties alſo of Ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: doth it therefore follow, that Evangeliſts were no extraordinary officers? For their two other Texts both to the ſame ſenſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.41. <hi>He that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Prophets reward.</hi> What though the promiſe here by analogy concerneth all ſuch as ſhall entertain Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118929:59"/> &amp;c. So doth the promiſe made to <hi>Joſhuah Joſh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee</hi> (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.6.) belong to all Chriſtians, yet it will not follow, that therefore <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary perſon, but a meer private perſon, nor yet that the promiſe did not primarily concern <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> as to his extraordinary ſervice in ſubduing the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> For the Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.32. <hi>Judas and Silas being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets alſo themſelves, exhorted the brethren, and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words confirmed them.</hi> Hence our Brethren conclude, <hi>the work of Prophets was exhorting, and ſay, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted becauſe they were Prophets.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 109.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Two things, or three muſt here be enquired: 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were not furniſhed with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts, or clothed with an extraordinary office or authority. 2. <hi>Whether they preached or no.</hi> 3.

            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> it is plain from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. that both <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were no ordinary perſons, there the Holy Ghoſt calls them, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. But another queſtion is, Whether this text proves <hi>they preached,</hi> the text ſays they <hi>exhorted,</hi> but all exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not preaching: The truth is, they were ſent with

It was made to let us know the dignity of the perſons ſent as Meſſengers from the Synod; they were no ordinaty perſons, no, they were <hi>Prophets.</hi> For their laſt Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.8. concerning <hi>the propheſying of the two witneſſes,</hi> Our brethren grant that they cannot determine <hi>what act is meant by it:</hi> No more can we, only I obſerve there were to be but two of them, ſo that the <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>office</hi> was no ordinary gift or office, and that is enough for us: We do not ſay, but to ſome ſingle Chriſtian ſince the Apoſtles times, yea even in our times, God may have given to know and foretell <hi>things to come.</hi> Our brethren know there are ſeveral rare inſtances in ſeveral Ages to prove it. For our Brethrens laſt inſtance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> ver. 20. <hi>No prophecie of the Scripture is of private interpretation,</hi> I cannot conceive the force of any thing in that Text: That the Scripture is partly a word of Prophecie, every one knows; and our Brethren hnow the whole is oft denominated from the name of the part, by an eaſie trope. We think that text rather fights againſt our Brethren than for them; for it ſays, <hi>no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of the Scripture</hi> (i. e. which is found in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) <hi>is of private interpretation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. As to our fourth preſumption that prophecie was no ordinary but extraordinary Gift, becauſe <hi>it

               <q>Our Brethren anſwer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20.<note place="margin">Pag. 111.</note> that the reaſon why it is preferred before tongues, is expreſſed, there becauſe <hi>it is of more publike uſe for edification.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We ſay that was <hi>one reaſon,</hi> but according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (in caſe he that ſpake <hi>with tongues did interpret</hi>) that reaſon failed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.5. and then another muſt be found. And as to this reaſon, though the Prophet were greater in one reſpect, yet he was leſs in another; for he could ſhew no <hi>ſign</hi> for the confirmation of the truths he ſpake.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We had told our Brethren, that the formal effect of <q>
                  <hi>publike edifying, comforting, edifying, convincing, converting ſouls,</hi> are aſcribed to theſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. and therefore ſome thought they were officers.</q> To this our Brethren anſwer, <hi>Paſtors and Teachers are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers, and their gifts ordinary, yet they are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to theſe ends:</hi> What doth this prove? <hi>Ergo, If Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets be officers,</hi> their gifts alſo may be ſo uſefull: I think that is all. If theſe Prophets were any <hi>species</hi> of officers, it is enough for our turn.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <q>We told our brethren, <hi>prophecying is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the word of wiſdom, and from the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9, 10, 11. To this our brethren an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer three things. 1 <hi>So exhortation is diſtinguiſhed from prophecy,</hi> Rom. 12.6, 7, 8. yet the Prophets ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.32. 2. It is hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the ſpecial reaſon, <hi>why the Apoſtles ſometimes diſtinguiſhed</hi> thoſe things each from other, which in themſelves ſeem alike, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.6. 3. If becauſe prophecying is diſtinguiſhed from the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the word of wiſdom, we will conclude, that by prophecying muſt be meant foretelling things to come, then we muſt conclude two ſorts of Prophets, one whoſe proper work ſhould be to foretell things to come; Another whoſe proper diſtinctive act ſhould be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118929:61"/> to <hi>exhort,</hi> convince and comfort, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I Reply.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is nothing more clear, than that the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. is ſpeaking of a <hi>diverſity of Gifts,</hi> divided (as he ſaith) <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>to every man ſeverally;</hi> from whence it will follow, that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> is neither the <hi>word of wiſdom,</hi> nor <hi>knowledge, nor faith,</hi> nor the <hi>gift of healing,</hi> nor the <hi>gift of working miracles,</hi> nor the <hi>gift of diſcerning spirits,</hi> nor the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> nor the <hi>interpretation of tongues;</hi> but the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal gift of prophecy,</hi> muſt be ſome ninth thing, diſtinct from all theſe.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, it will not follow, but ſome perſons might have more than <hi>one of theſe gifts,</hi> though every one had not more than one, yet ſome might, as <hi>Paul had the word of knowledge,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>tongues,</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> and <hi>interpretation of tongues:</hi> So I ſee nothing to hinder, but he that had the <hi>special gift of prophecie,</hi> might beſides have the <hi>word of wiſdom and knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſing prophecie to have been a gift of <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling things to come,</hi> or <hi>explication of Scripture by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit, without uſe of means;</hi> yet they might ſpeak <hi>edification, exhortation,</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> which is all menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. the Prophets of old, <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> &amp;c. did all; but the <hi>nature of their gift,</hi> and the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical difference of it did not lye <hi>in the thing spoken,</hi> or <hi>the End,</hi> but in the <hi>principle,</hi> enabling them ſo to ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Brethren therefore ſhall never prove, that <hi>exhortation,</hi> &amp;c. was the <hi>diſtinctive act</hi> of the Prophet (as they would inſinuate) for they themſelves muſt grant that common to <hi>Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> with them, and this is an anſwer to their third thing. For what they ſay before, that <hi>prophecie,</hi> Rom. 12.6, 7, 8. is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>exhortation,</hi> it ſignifies nothing, becauſe <hi>exhortation</hi> was not the act of Prophets as <hi>Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:118929:61"/>
            <p>It was told our Brethren, that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith: <q>Whether there be prophecies, they ſhall fail, whether there be tongues, they ſhall ceaſe, whether there be knowledge, that ſhall vaniſh away. <hi>Our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren anſwer,</hi> ver. <hi>9, 10. it ſhall be,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 114.</note> when that which is in part is done away: <hi>2.</hi> Not till the ceaſing of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in part.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We may as well <hi>maintain tongues not to be ceaſed;</hi> for they alſo are mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. as things which ſhould fail, and we know they are failed, and ſo (we judge) are <hi>prophecies</hi> too: nor will it help our Brethren (which they ſay) that <hi>ver.</hi> 9. it is not ſaid <hi>tongues are in part;</hi> for the reaſon is, becauſe they were perfect <hi>in their kinde,</hi> and ſo need not be done away, when that which is <hi>perfect ſhould come;</hi> but if we take <hi>perfect in a true ſenſe,</hi> for a <hi>perfection of the Saints in glory,</hi> then indeed they were imperfect things, ſerving only as means in order to that end: Neither doth the Apoſtle ſpeak of the <hi>coming of that which is perfect,</hi> as the moving cauſe, or reaſon of that ceaſing of things that were in part; he doth not ſay, <hi>that which is in part ſhall be done away, by the coming of that which is perfect;</hi> but he ſpeaks of it as a conſequent. The true ſenſe is this, <hi>Both ordinary and extraordinary gifts and offices in the Church ſhall ceaſe when we come in heaven;</hi> we conceive by tongues, and prophecy he means gifts extraordinary; By <hi>knowledge</hi> ordinary gifts and offices, theſe ſhall all fail at that day, but ſome of theſe ſhall fail before others. We lay no great ſtreſs upon this Text, I have only ſaid thus much to prevent our Brethrens uſing of it, as they here do, though without any juſt ground; for the truth is, it will ſerve neither party.</p>
            <q>It was told our Brethren, that prophecying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. is ſaid not to ſerve <hi>for thoſe that believed not, and therefore our Brethren muſt keep their Gifted men to their Churches.</hi> If any
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118929:62"/> thing can be clear in Scripture; ſurely this is from that Text, <bibl>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>To this our Brethren Anſwer,</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. "<hi>That it will warrant their preaching in Church Aſſemblies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Apoſtles intent ſeemeth to be, but to deny prophecy to be a ſign to unbelievers, and to ſerve onely for Believers to edifie them; but they ſay the Apoſtle acknowledgeth it to be uſefull to unbelievers to convert them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If there were any Prophets indeed, this would war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the exerciſe of their gifts to Church Aſſemblies; but our Brethren cannot prove any ſuch Prophets now exiſtent.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, It is well our Brethren ſay no more, than this <hi>ſeemeth to be the Apoſtles intent;</hi> for the Letter of Scripture is expreſs againſt them in theſe words.</p>
            <q>Wherefore tongues are for a ſign,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22.</note> not to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but to them that believe not, but prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not for them that believe not, but for them that believe.</q>
            <p>Our Brethren would make us believe, that the ſenſe is only, that prophecie was not for a ſign to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not, but for their converſion it might be. Let any indifferent Reader weigh this a little, and judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is plain, that if prophecying were <hi>for any ſign,</hi> it muſt be for unbelievers, for believers needed no ſign, they had already received the Goſpel: but the Apoſtle plainly ſays, it was not for <hi>unbelievers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let any Reader judge, whether thoſe words— <hi>But prophecying not for thoſe who believe not</hi>—do not plainly exclude the Ordinance from any relation to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers; if it were a <hi>ſign</hi> at all, it muſt be for them who believed not: but ſay our Brethren, it is denied to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118929:62"/> be a <hi>ſign for them;</hi> and the words are plain enough, it is <hi>not for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Oh! <hi>But though it be not a ſign for them, yet it might be to convert them,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Signs were to help forward the unbelievers convetſion; now that prophecy ſhould be for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and not a ſign for it, ſeems very harſh, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that the world had no greater ſign of the truth of the Goſpel than <hi>Prophecies.</hi> For what our Brethren ſay, that <hi>ver</hi> 25, 26. prove that <hi>prophecy</hi> is uſefull for the converſion of unbelievers, We grant it, but it is <hi>When the unbeliever comes in to the Church Aſſembly,</hi> not when the <hi>Prophet goes out to them,</hi> ver. 23. <hi>If therefore the whole Church be come together into one place,</hi>—and ver. 24. <hi>There come in one that believeth not, or is unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he is convinced</hi> [or reproved] of all [<hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe that propheſie] <hi>he is judged of all,</hi> &amp;c. Mark, the Prophet is tied up to the <hi>Aſſembly of the Church in one place:</hi> If our <hi>Brethrens</hi> Brethren be of this ſort of Prophets, what do they travelling up and down Countreys? (whom they think unbelievers) or intruding upon Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are vacant? where there is no Aſſembly, our Brethren will own as a Church? theſe Prophets were not (by vertue of this Text) to be ſent out of the Church, only to be heard in it.</p>
            <p>This is all our Brethren ſay about theſe Prophets, and although I really think their Argument from this Text, the moſt probable of any they have; yet I hope an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Reader will from what I have ſaid, judge it not <hi>concluſive</hi> in the caſe. I wonder at the reverend opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Brethren expreſs of their other Arguments in compariſon of this. But let the Reader judge. Only led me add one text more to prove this <hi>prophecying</hi> an <hi>extraordinary gift,</hi> not <hi>ordinary;</hi> it is that,</p>
            <p>Acts 19.6. <hi>And when</hi> Paul <hi>had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghoſt came on them, and they spake with tongues, and propheſied,</hi>

            <p>OUr <hi>Brethren</hi> in their tenth Chapter pretend to Anſwer my Arguments againſt the licentious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the ordinary Preaching of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. My firſt Argument I laid thus,
<q>
                  <p>Not to obſerve Gospel-order in acts of inſtituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is ſinfull.</p>
                  <p>But for private Chriſtians (how well gifted ſoever) to preach ordinarily, <hi>i. e.</hi> to open and apply Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, in publike Church-Aſſemblies, is for them in acts of inſtituted worſhip, not to obſerve Gospel-Order—<hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I preſumed our Brethren would only deny the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> which I thus proved.</p>
            <q>
               <p>To adventure upon an adminiſtration of a Gospel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, without ſuch a Miſſion, as Gospel-precepts require, and Gospel-Preſidents hold forth ſuch ſhould have as ſo adminiſter, is not to obſerve Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Order in Gospel-Worſhip.</p>
               <p>But for ſuch to open and apply Scriptures is to do ſo: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:118929:63"/>
            <p>I proved the <hi>Minor,</hi> becauſe all the precepts we have for the conſtitution of Elders in Churches conſtituting, or conſtituted, required that beſides their gifts, they ſhould, likewiſe be ſet apart by Ordination; and all the Preſidents we have of perſons Preaching in a ſetled ſtate of the Church ordinarily, were of perſons ſo ſet apart by Ordination.</p>
            <p>Now what ſay our Brethren to all this?</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. They doubt whether I would have my Major Propoſition underſtood univerſally.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 194.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But anon, they ſuppoſe it, and they deny my <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and ſay,</hi> that neither do Goſpel-Precepts require, nor Goſpel-Preſidents hold forth, that all thoſe that preach the Goſpel ſhould be ſolemnly ſet apart to the work. <hi>Then they review the Texts quoted by me: as to the Text,</hi> Titus <hi>1.5. they ſay,</hi> it only concerns El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>The ſame they anſwer to</hi> Acts <hi>14.23.</hi> Acts <hi>13.3, 4, 5. only as to 1</hi> Tim. <hi>5.22.</hi> they doubt whether by laying on of hands be not meant, conferring the gifts of the holy Ghoſt (becauſe laying on of hands was uſed in that caſe too) and <hi>Timothy</hi> was an Evangeliſt, and as for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Acts <hi>13.3.</hi> they were officers and preachers before; <hi>this</hi> is all they have, <hi>pag. 193, 194, 195.</hi> as to my firſt Argument <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p n="1">1. That according to our Brethrens <hi>Logick</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us before, <hi>That indefinite Propoſitions are uſually equipollent to univerſals:</hi> Our Brethren needed not have doubted, but that I underſtood the Propoſition univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally. However, I do not love to trouble my Readers with ſuch fallacies, as arguing from particulars to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; but I ſtill maintain, that <hi>no precept,</hi> no <hi>preſident in the Goſpel allows the ordinary publike preaching of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons meerly gifted, in a ſetled ſtate of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they</hi> were ſuch as had the extraordinary <hi>gifts of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> or ſuch (as according to Scripture-direction) preached only <hi>probationis</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:118929:64"/>
            <p>Secondly (this being a negative) I had no way to make a ſtrict proof, unleſs we had come to an argument <hi>vivâ vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> then our Brethren know I ſhould have argued thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Goſpel-hath any Precepts, or Preſidents, they muſt be found in the Gospels, Epiſtles, Acts, or Revelations:</hi> And ſo have followed on the Argument, till I had brought them to aſſign the Place, or the Preſident. If they had inſtanced in the <hi>ſcattered Chriſtians,</hi> Acts 9.11. all would have ſeen it had been nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for they were ſome of thoſe upon whom the Holy Ghoſt fell; and the Church was under perſecution. If they had inſtanced in <hi>Apollo,</hi> he was either an <hi>officer,</hi> or at leaſt a <hi>probationer;</hi> if they had told us of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> if they were not ordinary officers (as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> thinks) yet it is plain they had <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts</hi> (as I have proved) if they had brought that general Text, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. I had told them (what I have now ſaid) that if they will underſtand that Text in the general of any gift to be exerciſed, without any more ado, then the gifted men may command <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and adminiſter <hi>Sacraments;</hi> if they reſtrain it, we have as much warrant to reſtrain it to <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the diſtribution of the gifts of Providence. So that conſidering the nature of my Argument, it was enough for me (till they had aſſigned precepts, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents) to inſtance in ſuch precepts and preſidents as the Scripture afforded, laying moſt ſtreſs upon what I found in <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (thoſe Epiſtles containing the ſtanding Rules for the Government of the Churches planted and ſetled.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It was enough for me, who knew no other ordinary Preachers than <hi>teaching Elders</hi> (beſides extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary officers) that the Scripture owns; to prove <hi>they</hi> were ordained; they are thoſe only that were to <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the word and Doctrine,</hi> that was their work, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. and they have their <hi>denomination</hi> from it,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118929:64"/> from feeding called Paſtors, and from <hi>Teaching</hi> called Teachers, and if every one might ordinarily, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly feed and teach; I know not for what uſe their names ſerved, which uſually are given to perſons and things to diſtinguiſh them from others.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as to what they ſay, that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>may be meant of conferring the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> They ſhould firſt have proved that <hi>Timothy</hi> had any ſuch power, his being an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> proves no ſuch thing, but only that he was left at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to put the newly planted Churches into order; the Apoſtles in regard of their travelling, not being able to ſtay ſo long, nor do I finde any thing to perſwade me <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelf had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thoſe <hi>extraordinary gifts;</hi> however, the <hi>caution</hi> had bin needleſs; for it is plain, there was no long trial of any who received thoſe gifts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.4.4.31. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.17. Neither do I believe thoſe gifts were by the Apoſtles hands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to any, but upon <hi>extraordinary revelation</hi> made firſt to them, directing upon whom they ſhould lay their hands: Hence they prayed, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15. <hi>That the people might receive the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and yet laid no hands on <hi>Simon,</hi> though <hi>he believed,</hi> and was <hi>baptized,</hi> Acts 8.13. Beſides, I hope our Brethren will not ſay, the laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. was the conferring thoſe Gifts.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As to that inſtance, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. I made no further uſe of than to conclude the great honour God put upon this Ordinance; I granted <hi>Paul</hi> was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Officer, and Preacher before: yet that the Lord may let us know his everlaſting will, concerning ſuch as ſhould be mediately ſent out by the Church, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> (though extraordinarily Commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) yet being to be ſent out by the Church, are (to ſhew what all Churches ſhould do) ſent out by <hi>ſolemn faſting, and prayer, and laying on of hands;</hi> how much more ſhould others, who can pretend no ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118929:65"/> gifts or office. And this is I think enough to ſet my firſt Argument on its legs again.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Argument I ſtated thus.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vindiciae</hi> pag. 33.</note>
               <hi>For any who are no Officers to take upon them to do Acts of office is ſinfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for perſons meerly gifted; to preach ordinarily in publike Aſſemblies in the ſetled ſtate of the Church, is for perſons who are no officers, to take upon them to do Acts of office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to multiply words needleſly; by Acts of Office I meant <hi>Acts peculiar to office;</hi> then (ſay our Brethren) <hi>they deny my aſſumption.</hi> Preaching (they ſay) is not an act peculiar to office; I foreſaw this, and therefore laid in ſome proof for it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The proper acts of Paſtors and Teachers, &amp;c. are acts peculiar to office.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But ordinary preaching in publike Church-Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, in a ſetled ſtate of the Church, is the proper act of <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>proper Acts</hi> our Brethren might have concluded, that I meant proper <hi>quarto modo,</hi> ſuch as are peculiar to them: Then (they tell me) they deny the <hi>Minor;</hi> and (Reader) this is it that they affirm, <hi>That preaching is not the peculiar work of a preaching Elder, teaching the truth</hi> is not the <hi>peculiar work of a Teacher;</hi> but although <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> be ſtanding Officers in the Church of Chriſt, who muſt and ought to Preach, yet others may preach as well as they. Our Brethren do allow, that Paſtors and Teachers are needfull to feed the flock of Chriſt; but yet that <hi>this flock</hi> may feed it ſelf; that Chriſt hath appointed ſome, whoſe ordinary work ſhould be to <hi>teach,</hi> and whoſe <hi>office</hi> it <hi>ſhould be,</hi> to the performance of which <hi>they muſt be ſet apart;</hi> but yet there are others who may do the ſame thing without being ſet apart; this is clearly our Brethrens ſenſe, but how conſiſtent with reaſon, let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge.

               </gap> will lye upon our Brethren to give an inſtance <hi>of any one in Scripture,</hi> except <hi>extraordinary perſons</hi> (in reſpect of <hi>extraordinary gifts and offices</hi>) who (not in order to Ordination) <hi>in a ſetled ſtate of the Church, did ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily preach, or any precept to warrant ſuch for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> We have proof enough in Scripture that the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and <hi>Officers of the Church did it.</hi> I can yield it our Brethren, that the name <hi>Teacher</hi> is to diſtinguiſh from him that <hi>exhorteth;</hi> but the name of <hi>Teacher</hi> and <hi>Paſtor</hi> too, muſt have <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>exhorting,</hi> as their proper acts, by the force of the ſame Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. <hi>That work upon which the Officer of the Church is to wait, that is his peculiar work: but preaching is that work upon which Paſtors and Teachers are to wait,</hi> Rom. 12.7, 8. <hi>That by Gods appointment</hi> it ſhould be the work and charge of ſome, to wait upon the performance of an action, which any others may do as well, and as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily as they, is a ſtrange piece of ſenſe:<note place="margin">Pag. 199.</note> Our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>p.</hi> 199. argue fallaciouſly, when they ſay, <hi>Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution is an act of the Deacons office,</hi> and yet <hi>every one may diſtribute: Diſtribution of the Churches ſtock</hi> is indeed an act of the <hi>Deacons Office,</hi> and this none but they may diſtribute: They might as well have ſaid, <hi>ſpeaking is the act of a man:</hi> Ergo, Preaching the word is not peculiar to office: He that <hi>breaks Bread,</hi> and gives it to another, doth materially (in our Brethrens ſenſe) the Acts of him that adminiſtreth the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: Yet our Brethren will grant, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental breaking of Bread is an act of Office; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution to the poor is not materially an act of the Deacons Office; but <hi>diſtribution of the Churches ſtock is,</hi> and that none may do (if the Church have Deacons) but they.</p>

                  <p>If Baptizing be an act peculiar to office, then is preaching ſuch.</p>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I proved the conſequence,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Becauſe they are both in the ſame Commiſſion.</hi>
                  </item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Our Brethren of <hi>London</hi> had uſed the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and brought the ſame Text in juſtification of it, to which theſe Brethren endeavoured an anſwer, <hi>ch.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 165, 166, &amp;c. To which here they refer me, yet withall, <hi>pag.</hi> 200. they give me a repetition. I will fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſum up what they ſay in both places.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Our Brethren ſay, 1. <hi>That the Argument fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth as heavy upon us; for we will allow Probationers to preach, yet not to Baptize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Some</hi> (they ſay) <hi>think the Commiſſion,</hi> Matth. 28.19, 20. <hi>is given to the Apoſtles as Officers; and that there is another Commiſſion for gifted men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (Thirdly) <hi>they tell us it is a miſtake; for the Commiſſion,</hi> Matth. 28.19, 20. <hi>is not that which impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men to preach. It was only an enlarging of a former Commiſſion, and a making the Gentiles capable of being preached unto. For the Apoſtles preached, and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed before,</hi> Mark 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7.—The Apoſtles (they ſay) <hi>received as much power by this Commiſſion, as any others their Succeſſors could, but they received no Office-power by it.—It can,</hi> they ſay, <hi>only be concluded from hence, that thoſe who were in office before, might go and preach to the Gentiles.</hi>—Hence they deny, <hi>that the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe two acts together in that Commiſſion doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that all who may do the one may do the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly (they ſay) ſome deny that <hi>preaching</hi> is a greater <hi>work than baptizing:</hi> Here they quote (a great Friend of theirs) Dr. <hi>Homes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>page</hi> 170. they ſuppoſe <hi>preaching the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118929:66"/> work;</hi> (elſe where our Brethren ingenuouſly grant they think it is, <hi>pag.</hi> 233.) <hi>yet it doth not follow, that thoſe who do the greater may do the leſs, becauſe the leſs may be more limited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, <hi>They finde, that men out of Office are allowed to perform the ſame acts, which have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of preaching, and for the ſame end,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preaching without Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>p.</hi> 165, &amp;c.</note> Matth. 18.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Now they cannot finde the Goſpel allowing men out of Office, to perform that act called Baptizing, and that for the proper end which that Ordinance of Baptiſm is inſtituted for.</hi> This is the ſum of all ſaid in many more words, <hi>page</hi> 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 199, 200.</p>
            <p>Now let us examine what there is in all this to prove, <hi>That thoſe who may preach, may not baptize,</hi> when as Chriſt with the ſame breath ſaid, <hi>Go preach and baptize,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he was not ſent to <hi>baptize,</hi> i. e. <hi>that was not his main act, but to preach.</hi> I ſhall ſhortly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all our Brethren ſay.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Under favour, our Brethren are miſtaken in the fall of the Argument from this Text upon us, who allow <hi>Probationers</hi> to preach: For 1. They were excepted out of the queſtion, as being by a ſpecial rule in Gods word diſpenſed with. Our Brethren can ſhew no ſuch Rule for their gifted men. 2. Neither do we allow them to preach <hi>ordinarily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing they ſay, to make their aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good, they muſt bring forth that ſame other <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for gifted men,</hi> before we ſhall believe it: if it be that <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7. Our Brethren acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they <hi>baptized too,</hi> the Text proves they had power to <hi>work miracles, ver.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to what they ſay next, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>is not that Commiſſion which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizeth any to preach,</hi> we muſt crave leave to deny it. Their Argument is this.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:118929:67"/>
               <p>That Commiſſion which did not give authority to the Apoſtles themſelves to Preach and Baptize, did not give others authority, claiming by and under the ſame Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>But that Commiſſion did not give them Authority: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> we confeſs (as to the preſent Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) The <hi>Minor</hi> we deny. All they have to prove it is this:
<q>
                  <p>What authority they had before, that Commiſſion did not give.</p>
                  <p>But they had authority before to Preach, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> we grant, the <hi>Major</hi> we deny.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, that if a man hath two Commiſſions to the ſame work, he is by both of them impowered, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, and made in Office. Suppoſe an act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament conſtituteth ſome as Commiſſioners for <hi>ejection of ſcandalous Miniſters in the County of</hi> Norfolk: and afterwards, another Act paſſeth to the ſame purpoſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging alſo their power, to the <hi>City and County of</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, doth not the later <hi>Commiſſion authorize</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power</hi> them as well as the firſt? It is true, that Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. was not the firſt Commiſſion that impowered them to Preach, but it did impower them ſurely; for the ſame authority is in the latter as in the former.</p>
            <p>Secondly, our Brethren grant <hi>they were in no office to the Gentiles without that Commiſſion;</hi> therefore I think that Commiſſion impowred them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, our Saviour ſaw, that after his Aſcenſion, there might be ſome queſtion, whether they might Preach, and Baptize, as they had done (during his Life) and whether any others might in that work ſucceed them, by authority from Chriſt, he therefore reneweth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth their Commiſsion, and by making an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118929:67"/> promiſe to thoſe who ſhould ſucceed them in that work, he doth eſtabliſh a conſtant office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>As to their fourth Allegation, it being that which our Brethren refuſe to own, or inſiſt upon, I ſhall ſpend no time about it.</p>
            <p>For what they ſay fifthly, that <hi>ſuppoſing Preaching the greater work,</hi> yet it may be that <hi>Baptizing, which is the leſs, may be limited to Officers, and yet not that;</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> may be ſo indeed, but it is not very likely.</p>
            <p>And I ſuppoſe our Brethren muſt produce a very plain Scripture to prove the limitation, before they will make any endued with a competency of reaſon believe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God hath by his <hi>will</hi> in his word authorized <hi>Miniſters in office,</hi> to <hi>Preach,</hi> and to <hi>Baptize,</hi> and in the ſame word declared, that <hi>Preaching</hi> is the great, and <hi>chief act,</hi> to which he hath ſent them, and rather ſent them for that than for the other, <hi>viz. Baptizing,</hi> and yet it is his will, that any ordinary gifted perſons may perform that greater act, but none but thoſe Officers may do the leſs: He that hath ſo much, credulity as to afford any to ſuch an aſſertion may; in the mean time our Brethren have not brought us one title of Scripture, to prove the <hi>limitation</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> Some thing of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they pretend to, in what they ſay in the ſixth place, that they finde in Scripture, that other perſons beſides Officers may <hi>do the acts of Preaching,</hi> and <hi>for the ends;</hi> the acts, <hi>viz. admonition, exhortation,</hi> Mat. 18.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13.10.25. for the ends, <hi>viz. to prevent ſin, build up in grace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Exhorting,</hi> ſimply conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without reference to the <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> are not the <hi>acts of Preaching; ordinary Admoniſhing,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting</hi> in the publick Aſſemblies of the Church, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. <hi>The pronouncing of the words,</hi> which <hi>the Judge</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:118929:68"/> in paſsing Sentence upon a Malefactor, is not the act of <hi>his Office,</hi> unleſs pronounced in due manner, upon the Arraignment, and condemnation of a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor in an open Court after Trial.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Oh but it ſerveth to the ſame end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> This is not enough to make it the <hi>ſame act.</hi> An Highway-man may pronounce the ſame Sentence the Judge doth, and to the ſame end, yet his act is <hi>not the ſame:</hi> But it is they ſay, <hi>materially</hi> the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Brethren in this ſay nothing, for this doth not Legitimate the action; our Brethren may do actions <hi>materially</hi> the ſame with ſuch as are commanded, and yet ſin in doing of them, in this or that place, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; it is therefore no conſequence, that becauſe our Brethren no where read in Scripture that any but Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers did <hi>materially</hi> the <hi>acts of Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. But do read that they did the <hi>material acts</hi> of Preaching, <hi>Ergo</hi> They may Preach but not Baptize.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, Our Brethren need no Scripture to prove, that any man may do the <hi>material acts</hi> of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and adminiſtring the Supper: The material act of the one is <hi>sprinkling or powering water</hi> upon a face; of the other, a <hi>breaking of bread, and giving it to others.</hi> None ever queſtioned but every one may do theſe acts, and our Brethren oft do it to their children: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is no ground of reſtraining thoſe from Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Sacraments whoſe authority to preach we implead. And ſo much ſhall ſerve for the vindication of my ſecond Argument.</p>
            <p>My third Argument was: <q>From the uſeleſneſs of the great Ordinance of the Miniſterial Office, as to its chief act, <hi>viz.</hi> Preaching, if this practice be allowed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now the word of God cannot be ſo contrary to it ſelf, as, firſt to ſet up an Office, and then to make it uſeleſs as to its chief work.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:118929:68"/>
            <p>To make this good, I had but two things to prove: 1. <hi>That Preaching is the chief act of the Ministerial Office.</hi> 2. <hi>That if every one who hath gifts may preach, there were no need of the Miniſterial Office</hi> (as to its chiefeſt act.)</p>
            <p>To prove it to be the chief Act of the Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I urged,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is the firſt Act mentioned in the Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Commiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That</hi> St. <hi>Paul makes it his chief act,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to Baptize, but to Preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Either this is the chief act of the Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or a Miniſter hath no act proper to him, but that of adminiſtring Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper.</hi> But no Scripture ſhews theſe more peculiar to him.</p>
            <p>To all this our Brethren anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>That <hi>the order of words</hi> doth not prove <hi>preaching</hi> the chief act, <hi>in that Commiſſion, Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. Neither did I bring it as a demonſtrative Argument: but I do not think Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> his aſſertion true, that <hi>Preaching</hi> is but a preparation to <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> for he will find it muſt follow Baptiſm as well as go before it, <hi>Teaching them</hi> to obſerve, &amp;c. That ſame <hi>But</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a but of the Doctors own ſetting up, which all Scripture, and right reaſon will throw down.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>But to make my work ſhort, our Brethren, <hi>p.</hi> 203. at laſt do grant that Preaching is the <hi>chief act</hi> of the Miniſterial office, and that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. doth evidently prove it: So doth that <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8.</q> Take from thoſe two Texts theſe two Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That piece of the Miniſterial work, for the diſcharge of which God eſpecially deſigns his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters when he ſends them, that is their chief work.</p>
            <p>But Preaching is ſuch, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. That piece of the Miniſterial working, upon
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118929:69"/> which the Miniſter is moſt eſpecially to wait, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to neglect other parts than that, that is their chief work.</p>
            <p>But Preaching is that piece of the Miniſterial work upon which Miniſters of the Goſpel are eſpecially to wait, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. to which they are eſpecially ordained, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11.</note> to which they are in ſpecial manner to give attendance, both to be prepared for it, and to do it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13, 14, 15, 16. and to do it well, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. they are rather to neglect others than that, as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Baptizing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14, 15, 16, 17. And the Apoſtles judged it not meet they ſhould <hi>leave the word of God to ſerve Tables,</hi> Acts 6.2.—<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I think our Brethren have but done them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves right, in judging Preaching the <hi>chief and main work of the Miniſterial Office,</hi> p. 203. But (ſay they)</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 203.</note>
               <q>Yet we do not finde any Scripture Rule to evidence, that Preaching in it ſelf, is either an act of Office, or peculiar to the diſtinctive act of Office; to make it ſo, there is required a being over them in the Lord, who are preached to, <hi>1 Theſ. 5.12.</hi> —and this they conceive doth make Preaehing an act of Office, —<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What this ſerveth for, more than to blinde the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he may not ſee the ſtrength of our Argument, I cannot tell. Our Argument was this.</p>
            <q>
               <p>That which is the main Act of the Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for the performance of which God especially deſigned it, that is not lawfully to be performed, by ſuch as are in no Office; for it is the peculiar act of Office.</p>
               <p>But Preaching is the main and chief act for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which God hath ſet up an Office of the Miniſtry, and deſigned it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> our Brethren have granted; ſo that they muſt deny the <hi>Major</hi> or nothing; we prove it,
<q>
                  <p>God doth nothing in vain.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:118929:69"/>
                  <p>But in caſe he had ſet up an Office in his Church chiefly for the performance of an act, which many out of Office might do; he had as to that act ſet it up in vain.—<bibl>Ergo,</bibl> 
                     <hi>It is falſe that any other may do it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident to common ſenſe or reaſon; were it not a vain thing for a Prince to eſtabliſh an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Officers (ſuppoſe <hi>Juſtices of the Peace, Colonels,</hi> and <hi>Captains</hi> of Armies, <hi>Conſtables</hi> in Pariſhes) if by the Law every man, though in no ſuch office might do the main work that belonged to ſuch an Office?</p>
            <p>Hence we ſay, that the Lords eſtabliſhing a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing office of <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> and declaring in his Word, that the main end of his eſtabliſhing them, is for the <hi>Preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> doth clearly reveal his will, that this ſhould not be the work of any but ſuch Officers. Now what ſay our Brethren?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Preaching of a man in Office is an act peculiar to Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſum of what they ſay. If it be ſenſe, I am ſure it is nothing to the queſtion, which is plainly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the anſwer. For what is the Queſtion but this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether any but ſuch as are in Office may ordinarily Preach?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſay no, becauſe Preaching is an act <hi>peculiar to Office:</hi> this we prove, becauſe it is the <hi>main and chief act</hi> and end, for which God ſet up the Office. Our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren grant it to be the main and chief act, for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of which God ſet up the Office; and yet tell us, by and by, that Preaching is not ſo. <hi>But the Preaching of one in Office is ſo.</hi> Reader, if thou canſt pick out the ſenſe of this, I cannot.</p>
            <p>Our Brethten ſhould have done well to have given us the difference between <hi>ſimple Preaching,</hi> as it is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Chriſt, and <hi>Office-Preaching</hi> as they call it.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:118929:70"/>
            <p>If they mean by Preaching, <hi>An act of a perſon clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, by which in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Command, the Agent openeth and applyeth Scriptures in order to the converſion and edification of ſouls, and that in the publick Aſſemblies, and to which people ought to attend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſay, this muſt be an act of Office, and all ſuch Preaching is <hi>Office-Preaching,</hi> his <hi>authority</hi> puts him in Office. If they mean by Preaching,</p>
            <p>Any perſons diſcourſing of the Scripture, either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, or publickly, in ſuch a way, as that none is by Gods command obliged to hear him, nor can hear him looking upon what he does as the publick appointment of Chriſt, for the ſalvation of his ſoul; we allow gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men may <hi>Preach</hi> in this ſenſe: But we ſay, that (ſtrictly) this is no <hi>Preaching;</hi> it is no more than a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons reading a good Book, to whom people are not bound to reſort to hear, nor ought they ſo to do upon the Lords days, which ſhould be ſpent in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of publick worſhip.</p>
            <p>Our Brethren, <hi>p.</hi> 203. juſtly think, that in the hearts of ſome <hi>ſerious Christians,</hi> there may be ſome ſuch workings as theſe.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If this Doctrine be true, that all gifted men may by the command of Chriſt Preach ordinarily, as well as Paſtors, and Teachers; and all the Brethren have as much to do in ruling tne Church, as <hi>ruling Elders,</hi> ſurely both Preaching and Ruling Elders are uſeleſs: for to what purpoſe are they ſet a part for a work, which they might do without ſuch a ſetting apart, or any others do as well as they, when made Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſurely theſe principles have too much abſurdity in them, and bear too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the revealed will of God to be true.</p>
            </q>
            <p> But ſay our Brethren,</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:118929:70"/>
               <p>If all acts which Officers might put forth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 204.</note> might be performed by members not in Office, yet there would be enough to speak Officers neceſſary, and of great uſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though they put forth the ſame Acts, yet it is not under the ſame relation: A man provideth for his children as a Father, for the poor under another noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: A Chriſtian friend occaſionally gives wholſom inſtructions to the children of his acquaintance; ſo doth the Parent of theſe children; yet the manner is different, the one is under a ſtanding Obligation, the other not. The Bayliffs are needfull in Corporations, where the major part carry it without the Bayliffs ſometimes, <hi>pag. 205.</hi> Church-Officers have a special overſight <hi>over the</hi> flock, <hi>pag. 206. they</hi> are under a special deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.—If a Church hath Officers, they by their place, are to go before the Church, in directing, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting determinations.—But the Church may cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure without Officers, <hi>p. 207.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They ſay, that we</hi> allow ſuch an Office as hath no act peculiar to it, <hi>viz.</hi> Ruling Elders.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They do not ſay all may preach, but ſuch as are really gifted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If there be Scripture-Warrant for gifted mens Preaching, it is needfull, whether we can ſee it or no.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Preaching of Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts did not make the Office of Paſtors and Teachers needleſs; nor <hi>è contra,</hi> becauſe every Church-member may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute to the poor, it will not follow the Office of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con was needleſs.</p>
               <p>This is the ſum of what our Brethren ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209.</p>
            </q>
            <p> in many more words: To all which I ſhall give a ſhort anſwer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the preſent debate, I have nothing to do with arguing the needleſneſs of Officers, as to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118929:71"/> of the Church,</hi> of Officers; if others, beſides ſuch <hi>Officers,</hi> may act with them: Acts of Juriſdiction in the Church were never by Chriſt committed to the ſingle hand of any perſon, nor yet to any ſingle Office; I think neither the Miniſter alone, nor the Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders alone, nor the multitude alone are the Church, to which offences ſhould be told, or who can ſingly act in any formal cenſure (except in a very high Caſe of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.) The work of <hi>Preaching</hi> is of another nature, it is by Chriſts Order to be performed by this or that <hi>ſingle hand.</hi> It will not therefore follow, that becauſe there is a need of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> though <hi>ruling Elders</hi> (as we ſay) and the multitude as our Brethren ſay, ought to concur with them in acts of Cenſure and Diſcipline; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>herefore there <hi>is a need of Teaching Elders,</hi> though others may <hi>teach as well as they;</hi> for the work of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be (as I ſaid before) performed by <hi>ſingle hands,</hi> without a concurrence to the act of any others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers or Members, ſo may not acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to what our Brethren ſay, That <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> act under another relation, as <hi>ſet over people in the Lord,</hi> this amounts to no more than a <hi>notion,</hi> and makes no real difference: Let us examine what this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies. Will our Brethren ſay theſe Preach as appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, others not ſo? <hi>pag.</hi> 209. No ſay our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>the gifted men are alſo by Divine appointment to preach,</hi> ſo their authority is the ſame; Chriſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both the one, and the other (they ſay:) What then, do <hi>they not do the ſame material acts?</hi> That they do our Brethren told us, <hi>p.</hi> 200. they had <hi>found that</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: What then? Is not the end the ſame, to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, convert, exhort, edifie?</hi> Our Brethren told us, <hi>pag.</hi> 112. <hi>They knew not wherefore they ſhould propheſie, if there were no hope of ſuch effects.</hi> So then, our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> ſay, that gifted men have the ſame authority to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118929:71"/> preach, that <hi>teaching Elders;</hi> and <hi>teach the ſame things,</hi> &amp; <hi>to the ſame end.</hi> Now I wonder what this different <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which they here tell us of, ſignifies more then an empty notion: let us ſee if their ſimilitudes will help us: <hi>A man they ſay provideth for his children, as a father;</hi> for <hi>the poor under another notion.</hi> But the queſt. is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, viz. Whether it would be neceſſary, that there ſhould be a <hi>ſpecial order of perſons,</hi> called <hi>fathers,</hi> to provide for the poor, if every one were bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them; and to do the ſame acts, in the ſame order, and to the ſame end that they ſhould do. <hi>A Christian Friend,</hi> they ſay, <hi>occaſionaelly gives wholſom inſtructions to the children of his acquaintance, ſo doth the parents of thoſe children, yet the manner is different; the one is under a ſtanding Obligation, the other not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this ſimilitude runs on four feet, our Brethrens ſenſe is this, That there is a need of Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, though gifted men may Preach, <hi>becauſe gifted men are not under a standing Obligation to preach only, may do it occaſionally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then the ſenſe is this, gifted men may Preach, &amp; ſhall not need, except they liſt; they may preach, &amp; they may let it alone; but <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> they muſt do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they may let it aelone,</hi> I moſt freely grant: But that they may <hi>either do it,</hi> or <hi>let it alone,</hi> I can never grant: All the precepts our Brethren pretended to for this Preaching of gifted men, do not only (if they were to their purpoſe) aſſert their Liberty, but enjoyn it as their duty. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. He that hath received <hi>the gift is commanded to Minister;</hi> he that hath the gift of <hi>Prophecy</hi> muſt Prophecy. Our Brethren, ſay they, preach by <hi>Divine appointment,</hi> pag. 209. Now thoſe that are <hi>appointed</hi> to Preach, are not at their liberty, whether they will Preach or no. This pretence is therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding vain: beſides, it gives the gifted man a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over the <hi>Officer:</hi> for <hi>Greater is he that ſitteth at
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118929:72"/> the Table,</hi> and may chooſe whether he will ſerve, or no, <hi>than he who ſerveth,</hi> and muſt ſerve.</p>
            <p>For our Brethrens other inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Bayliffs in a Corporation may be uſefull, though the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell may act with them,</hi> it concerns not the preſent caſe; it may have ſomething in it to prove, that although the Members of the Church have a joynt power with the Officers of the Church, as to the executing ſome act of cenſure; yet there is a need of them as to <hi>other acts</hi> (and that is all it will do too in that Caſe) but here it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing, becauſe Preaching is an act which may be done by a ſingle perſon, and we argue that there is no need of a <hi>special order of ſingle perſons,</hi> to be in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for a work for which <hi>all were commiſsioned,</hi> and in which others may act.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is true that our Brethren ſay, we do allow ſuch an Office as we ſay, hath no <hi>act peculiar to it,</hi> viz. that of <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> their work is <hi>rule,</hi> and in that work they are joynt Commiſſioners with the <hi>Teaching El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> But the queſtion is, whether we allow ſuch <hi>as are not Officers</hi> to <hi>act in it.</hi> We ſay the office of ruling is a <hi>partible Office,</hi> divided betwixt the <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Rule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Elder; who (as to that work) make but one <hi>office,</hi> to the execution of which a double <hi>Species</hi> of Officers is (ordinarily) neceſſary. Theſe two (as heretofore the King, Lords, and Commons of <hi>England</hi> made up the three Eſtates, all neceſſary to enact a Law) do make up the two <hi>States</hi> as it were in the Church, without whom an act of Rule cannot be put forth, in ordinary caſes. But the caſe is quite another, as to the work of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which may be performed by a <hi>ſingle perſon.</hi> If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we had ſaid, that the <hi>Ruling Elder</hi> might alone <hi>without the Teaching Elder,</hi> have (in ordinary caſes) exerciſed acts of Rule, Our Brethren had ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and we ſhould have thought the Paſtors Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as to <hi>ruling needleſs,</hi> and ſo è <hi>contra</hi> we ſhould
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118929:72"/> have thought the <hi>ruling Elder needleſs,</hi> and ſhould ſo judge it, if we could ſee that the Paſtor (in ordinary caſe) without them might rule, which is the thing our Brethren plead for, the Preaching of Gifted men.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Our Brethren ſay they <hi>do not ſay all may preach, only thoſe who are gifted.</hi> But our Brethren dare not ſay, who ſhall judge that (as I noted before) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is <hi>all that will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Our Brethren ſay true, our reaſon muſt vail to the will of God revealed in Scripture. But when the queſtion is, <hi>whether there be any ground in Scripture for this liberty or no,</hi> and our Brethren have no plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to prove it, no particular Precept, no Preſidents but of perſons qualified with the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, that ever ordinarily preached, We hope our Friends will judge, that it is no light Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove our Brethren miſtaken in the Scriptures they pretend, becauſe their ſenſe of them being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a <hi>ſtanding</hi> Sacred Office of the Goſpel, plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many Scriptures, would be made fruſtraneous, and of no uſe.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, But Laſtly (ſay our Brethren) we do grant that <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> might <hi>Preach, yet was not the Office of Paſtors and Teachers needleſs.</hi> I Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is no conſequence; for <hi>Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists were Officers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They were virtually <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> they differed in nothing from them but the extent of their power.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There was a plain need of <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> notwithſtanding theſe extraordinary Officers: for 1. <hi>They were to endure but for a time.</hi> 2. <hi>They were not to be confined to a place;</hi> it had been ſin for them to have always ſtaid in one place. So that notwithſtanding
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118929:73"/> them, there was an apparent uſe of Paſtors &amp; Teachers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſay as to ſuch times as they were reſident in this or that particular Church, there was no need of any <hi>Paſtors</hi> or <hi>Teachers,</hi> becauſe they could do all their acts: But we hope our Brethren will not ſay ſo for their gifted men.</p>
            <p>And thus much may ſerve to have anſwered all they ſay againſt my third Argument.</p>
            <p>My fourth Argument, I laid thus,</p>

               <p>What things (by Scripture-warrant) are in publick Aſſemblies to be communicated unto others by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, who ſhall be able to teach others, and to whom ſuch things ſhall firſt be committed by Gods <hi>Timothies, thoſe things private perſons,</hi> to whom they are not ſo committed,may not ſo communicate.</p>
               <p>"But of this nature are Goſpel-Truths, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I granted our Brethren that the Greek word, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated <hi>Commit,</hi> did ſometimes ſignifie to <hi>propound a thing to others:</hi> But moſt properly ſuch a <hi>committing</hi> as is of <hi>a thing which is committed in truſt to one, not to another,</hi> as Luk. 12.48. Luk. 23.46. Act 13.43. Act. 20.32. 1 Tim. 1.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. I told them it could not be underſtood in the former ſenſe here; for ſo <hi>Timothy</hi> was to preach to <hi>unfaithfull men,</hi> as well as <hi>faithfull;</hi> but he is commanded only to commit theſe <hi>things to faithfull men;</hi> and it was not enough that theſe men were <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> faithful, but notwithſtanding that they muſt have theſe things committed to them, before they taught others.</p>
            </q>
            <p> Now let us hear our Brethren.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They grant that none but <hi>ſuch as are faithfull</hi> and <hi>able may teach others;</hi> and <hi>ſuch as</hi> are <hi>learned in Gospel myſteries:</hi> This will go a great way; for I hope our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will not judge him able to <hi>interpret the Gospel;</hi> that <hi>is not able to interpret the Gospel</hi> out of the Original into his own Tongue. I wonder how he ſhall diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

            <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Brethren</hi> know the <hi>Enallage</hi> of <hi>Tenſes</hi> is very ordinary in Scripture; the future uſed for the preſent, and the preſent <hi>for the future tenſe.</hi>

                  <hi>I told our Brethren,</hi> That <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded to commit theſe to faithfull men only, and ſuch as ſhould be able to teach others; therefore it could not be meerly doctrinally, for ſo they ſhould be committed to all.</q>

            <p>
               <q>To this I can finde no anſwer, only our Brethren ſay, that <hi>this is to ſhew unconverted men are not to be Preachers.</hi>2. <hi>Nor all that are converted, but ſuch as are able:</hi> 
               </q> But how this anſwers my Argument, I cannot gueſs; for if as our Brethren aſſert, <hi>the committing</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere but <hi>doctrinal</hi> that is here meant, it is ſure enough, they were thus to be communicated to the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas our Brethren ſay, that it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting theſe <hi>things to them makes them able.</hi> We grant it in the ſenſe of that known Maxime,
<q>Id tantum poſſumus quod jure poſſumus.</q> We ſay the Moral <hi>ability</hi> of the Preacher is created by his <hi>being authorized to the work,</hi> by a ſolemn ſeparation to the performance of it, without which, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be <hi>naturally able,</hi> yet none is morally able, as it is the Judges Commiſſion that makes him able to <hi>relieve the fatherleſs</hi> and oppreſſed <hi>Widow</hi> in Judgement.</p>
            <p>Our Brethren therefore (as their ſafeſt refuge) flie to the old <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>this was a Precept concerning Preachers by Office.</hi> The Text ſaith no ſuch thing, however, we own no others: whereas they ſay we <hi>muſt reſtrain it to publick Preaching:</hi> We ſay there is reaſon for it; for the Apoſtles buſineſs is to direct <hi>Timothy</hi> in the ſetling of Goſpel Churches, as to publick Officers and Adminiſtrations. And beſides Reaſon will tell us, that thoſe need not to have <hi>Timothy</hi> commit the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to them, who exhort from the obligation of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>Oeconomical</hi> duty. But we ſay, that all ſuch <hi>publick Teachers</hi> of others are here meant, as Preach with <hi>authority,</hi> obliging the Publick Aſſemblies of the Church to hear them, &amp; all ſuch as adminiſter that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious publick Ordinance of God, which we call <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and is the <hi>ordinary means</hi> of ſaving ſouls.</p>
            <p>And this is enough for the vindication of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. My fifth Argument was this.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:118929:74"/>
               <p>Whoſoever may lawfully Preach, may lawfully require a maintenance of the Church, to which they preach, <hi>1 Tim. 5.18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mat. 10.10. Gal. 6.6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all the Gifted Members of a Church cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Maintenance of the Church, wherein they are—<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Our Brethren deny the Major, and ſay, <hi>The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures alledged speak of a conſtant preaching:</hi> they ſay it, but they do not prove it; neither doth <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.10. nor <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. hint the leaſt of ſuch a thing; the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, <hi>he that laboureth, he that teacheth;</hi> our Brethren add <hi>constantly,</hi> by what authority I cannot tell.</p>
            <p>But our Brethren have much fault to finde with my <hi>Minor,</hi> it is <hi>neither true in matter nor form:</hi> A little matter will make it true in both. It is true (by a ſlip of my Pen) inſtead of <hi>the Church to which they Preach,</hi> I put in the Church <hi>in which they are:</hi> but it is the ſame thing; for admit that they may propheſie, I proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. that they had <hi>no warrant to go out of their Church to do it.</hi> If unbelieves come in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, well and good, but they have no rule to go out to them.</p>
            <p>Our Brethren here ſpend many words not to prove, but to ſpeak the ſame thing over again, <hi>viz.</hi> That for <hi>occaſional Preaching,</hi> wages, or <hi>maintenance</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be required. But where nothing is proved, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing need be anſwered; and all that our Brethren preach upon this ſubject, is both beſide the Texts quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by me, and without a <hi>Text</hi> produced by them.</p>
            <p>My ſixth Argument was from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. This they ſay, they anſwered before, indeed their whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth chapter was ſpent in an endeavour to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. It is too large to deſcribe; for it reacheth from <hi>pag.</hi> 116. to <hi>pag.</hi> 138. of their Book: I will therefore only lay before my Reader, <hi>the Sum of my Argument,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:118929:75"/> and then give a ſummary of <hi>what they anſwer.</hi> I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued thus,</p>

               <p>The proof of the <hi>Minor,</hi> brought me to examine, what it was to be ſent.</p>
               <p>Reaſon told me, Sending was the Act of <hi>another,</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> none can ſend himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who ſend, are either <hi>God, Angels,</hi> or <hi>Men;</hi> to the ſecond none pretends; of the firſt, the Text muſt be underſtood.</p>
               <p>Gods ſends either <hi>immediatly,</hi> or <hi>mediately: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by a voice from heaven;</hi> of this the Text can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant; for then <hi>farewell preaching,</hi> yea, and <hi>believing</hi> too, according to the force of that Text.</p>
               <p>God ſends mediatly <hi>by his Church,</hi> either by his Church <hi>electing,</hi> or <hi>ordaining:</hi> Let it be which way it will, meer gifts will not ſerve the turn. This was the ſubſtance of what I ſaid.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now let us hear what our Brethren ſay.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They grant Miſſion is of ordinary Teachers,</hi> pag. 118.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>That it continues in all Ages, but deny it eſſential to the conſtitution of a Miniſter by that Text; but ſay it is neceſſary to the Act of preaching,</hi> p. 119.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They deny the major of my firſt Syllogiſm, and the minor of my ſecond, and ſay, gifted perſons are ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>They ſay the ſending there is not an act, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Officer:</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe ſome who were Officers before had Miſſion afterwards,</hi> Matth. 28.19. 2. <hi>Becauſe it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118929:75"/> may be repeated without loſing the office,</hi> Matth. 10.5, 6.7. Chap. 28. <hi>v</hi> 19. 3. <hi>Becauſe ſome had Miſſion, who were no officers,</hi> Luk. 10.1. <hi>Becauſe all that are inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to Converſion would then be judged Officers,</hi> Rom. 10.14.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They ſay <hi>Miſſion is not ordination.</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe no Scripture ſaith it.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe then Deacons are ſent,</hi> Acts 6.6. 3. <hi>Becauſe Miſſion may be iterated, but not ordination;</hi> Matth. 10.5.28.19. 4. <hi>Becauſe a Church may Ordain its own Miniſter, but cannot ſend to it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>They grant, bare gifting, is not ſending,</hi> Matth. 10.1.56.7. <hi>Sending doth not make, but ſuppoſe them Preachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Sending</hi> (they ſay) <hi>is Chriſts commanding by his word, or aſſigning Preachers to go and publiſh the Goſpel.</hi> 2. <hi>Or a providential diſpoſing them to this or that people:</hi> Upon this they Comment largely; that this is ſending, they prove, <hi>p.</hi> 129. by <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.8, 9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14, 15, 23, 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They judge the ſenſe of the Text to be a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential ſending, <hi>p.</hi> 136. <hi>except they be ordered by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to go to ſuch a people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never love to throw a needle into a bottle of Hay, it is ſo hard to find it again; in theſe 22. <hi>pages,</hi> our little Argument is almoſt loſt; in ſhort, the Queſtion is this, whether <hi>gifted men, as gifted,</hi> be <hi>ſent, or no;</hi> if they be not they cannot actually (at leaſt) Preach. Let it be <hi>naturally</hi> or <hi>Morally,</hi> impoſſible. They cannot preach, except ſent: Our Brethren muſt ſay they are ſent, and ſo deny the <hi>Minor</hi> of my ſecond Syllogiſm: I proceed.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If they be ſent it muſt either be by Chriſt or by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
               <p>But we ſay they are not ſent by Chriſt; I hope our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will ſay they are not ſent by Antichriſt.—</p>

            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:118929:76"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> not at all. We prove the <hi>Minor,</hi>
               <q>
                  <p>If they be ſent by Chriſt it is either immediately or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
                  <p>But neither immediately nor mediatly — Ergo, <hi>not at all.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Brethren muſt deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> and ſay they are <hi>ſent immediately,</hi> for if they be ſent mediately, it muſt be by his <hi>Church, commanding, electing,</hi> or <hi>ordaining;</hi> which ſoever of theſe it is, it is more than <hi>gifted:</hi> The laſt our Brethren deny; the ſecond is non-ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſay the Church <hi>ſends by electing, chooſing, and ſending,</hi> are two things; as to the firſt, our Brethren judge it not neceſſary, though convenient.</p>
            <p>If their Miſſion be immediate, We always thought it muſt have been by <hi>Chriſts own voice,</hi> as he ſent the 70. and the 12. or by a ſign from heaven of his will as in the caſe of <hi>Matthias,</hi> or by <hi>extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> inabling them, to which was added a <hi>power of miracles,</hi> to confirm their Miſſion, and give them credit in the world: But our Brethren have found out two other ways.</p>

            <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, our Bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides, <hi>ſending makes</hi> them Officers, who ever I <hi>ſend is my Officer,</hi> the Kings Ambaſſador is his <hi>Officer;</hi> and ſo by this Rule they are all <hi>Gods Officers:</hi> no man can ſend another, but he is in office, as to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about he is ſent, nor will any thing our Brethren ſay evince the contrary: If a man be an Officer before, another Miſſion makes him ſtill an Officer; thoſe ſent, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. were <hi>Officers</hi> by their Miſſion; though <hi>Miſſion</hi> may be repealed, and yet the Office not loſt, yet Miſſion makes an <hi>Officer:</hi> My ſending of my ſervant to a place about my buſineſs makes him my Officer, as to that buſineſs, and if I ſend him a ſecond time, my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſending makes him my Officer too: I ſee no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in that, when the work is enlarged, as in thoſe inſtances, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. Nor will it follow, that then any that are inſtrumental to converſion are Officers, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>How can they believe on him of whom they have not heard; or how can they hear without a Preacher,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Brethren therefore muſt flee to their <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential ſending,</hi> and make this the ſenſe of the Text. <hi>How ſhall they preach, if God doth not by his providence direct, or permit them to Preach, if God doth not give them legs to ſtand, and a tongue to speak.</hi> Hence it follows,</p>
            <p>"That it is not a Moral but a natural poſſibility is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, as if a man ſhould ſay, <hi>How can a man ſee if his eyes be out?</hi>

            <p>And this our Brethren own, <hi>pag.</hi> 137. for they ſay <hi>all
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118929:77"/> the other interrogations deny a natural poſſibility.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader, doeſt not thou think this had been a great Goſpel-Myſterie (worthy of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to have told the <hi>Romans) none could preach if they had no tongue to ſpeak,</hi> or Gods Providence would not permit them to come in place where.

            <p n="1">1. If this notion of ſending be true, then <hi>none can run before they are ſent;</hi> for all motions are under the providence of God. But the Scripture plainly blames <hi>ſome that run before they were ſent.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Then the <hi>Creep-houſes</hi> mentioned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. <hi>were ſent,</hi> for they could never <hi>creep into houſes,</hi> but by divine providence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſay our Brethren, <hi>Gods command in his word muſt concur with his providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>What command is that?</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe</hi> our Brethren finde <hi>Deacons were ordained;</hi> but they do not finde they <hi>were ſent.</hi> It doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that becauſe the Ordination of Officers, by a Church to it ſelf cannot ſtrictly be called <hi>ſending</hi> (on the Churches part) therefore no <hi>Ordination</hi> is, or may, where the perſons are <hi>ordained</hi> Officers to more then thoſe that are in the <hi>Church</hi> which Ordaineth them.</p>

            <p>THe remainder of our Brethrens Book, concerning our <hi>Reverend Brethren</hi> of the <hi>Province of</hi> London, I take not my ſelf concerned to give a ſtrict anſwer to it, I will only ſpend this Chapter in reviewing a paſſage which I before ſlipped, and anſwering ſome things I finde in their eleventh Chapter, which may ſeem to take of my anſwer, to their greateſt proofs, for <hi>popular Elections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The paſſage which I ſlipped, is that which my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> ſhall finde in our Brethrens Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 68, 69, 70. where (to prove <hi>Apollo</hi> was at that time no Officer) they fight us with a weapon drawn out of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> Armory; and tell us, that <hi>Apollo, could at that time be no Officer, becauſe he knew only the Baptiſm of John,</hi> Acts 18.25. and <hi>p.</hi> 69. they tell us, <hi>that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of</hi> John, <hi>and the Baptiſm of Chriſt, are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each from other.</hi> This Argument (as to the matter of it) is purely <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and falſe, as to the form of it, and its uſage in this caſe is primarily <hi>Socinian,</hi> as to both falſe, and no way concluſive.</p>

            </p>
            <p>That Text quoted by our Brethren, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.3, 4, 5. proves nothing to the purpoſe; for they were not <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized

            <p>Our <hi>Brethren</hi> will eaſily judge, that their foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being thus deſtroyed, their Argument built upon this <hi>hay and ſtubble</hi> muſt fall. But that our brethren may be aſhamed ever to bring this Argument into the field again, I muſt tell them, that as the <hi>Papiſt</hi> laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; ſo the blaſphemous <hi>Socinian</hi> was the firſt I ever met with, who built upon it.</p>

               </note> who thought <hi>Apollo,</hi> no ordinarily <hi>gifted Brother,</hi> ſays thus. <hi>Firmum enim manet, quod tantum ſciverit Baptiſma Johannis,</hi> &amp;c. It is ſtrongly proved (ſaith he) <hi>For he had only the Baptiſm of</hi> John, <hi>and in that</hi> Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priſcilla <hi>inſtructed him more perfectly,</hi> &amp;c. I hope we ſhall hear no more of this Argument, to prove <hi>Apollo</hi> was no Officer. It is no great matter to our caſe if he were not; for (as I have ſaid) he was certainly a <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner</hi> to office, and in that notion might preach, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a <hi>Jewiſh Synagogue,</hi> and <hi>in that ſtate of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing (with which I ſhall conclude this Chapter, and my whole Diſcourſe, relateth to what our Brethren have brought to prove <hi>election neceſſary, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expreſs Scripture grounds,</hi> to the <hi>conſtitution of a Miniſter.</hi> To which purpoſe they produce three Texts; The firſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.23, 24, 25. The ſecond is, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. the third, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. I have ſaid ſomething before, to ſhew the invalidity of each of theſe. Our Brethren, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. pretend to take off ſomething which I ſaid: Let me examine with what ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:118929:80"/>1. As to the <hi>first instance,</hi> Acts 1. they muſt argue thus. <hi>If they may, and ought to chooſe the greater Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, then they ought to chooſe the leſs.</hi> As to the preſent caſe, we grant the conſequence, though it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, becauſe here is a different <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Officers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the people of a County may chooſe <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men</hi> by the Law, it will not follow that they may chooſe <hi>Juſtices of the Peace:</hi> Their power of choice reſulting not <hi>from nature,</hi> but from the <hi>Law of God,</hi> the conſequence in ſtrictneſs is naught, for Gods Law may will the firſt, and not the ſecond. Therefore this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument cannot be concluſive: but, I ſay, at preſent we allow it.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; ſure I am our Brethren can give no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon, to ſhew that it ſignifies otherwiſe here than the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (not excluſively to others, but <hi>empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically</hi> and more eminently than others) called <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> (as in many other Texts) and if this ſenſe be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, they were the Apoſtles only that did appoint the two, verſe 25. <hi>according to our Brethrens own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But laſtly, It is a plain caſe, <hi>God here choſe;</hi> for two <hi>ſtood forth,</hi> or were <hi>ſet forth;</hi> when this was done all the Church could not tell which ſhould be the Apoſtle, till God made the choice. Hence it is plain, that from this Text nothing can be concluded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſpeaks nothing of the choice of a <hi>Paſtor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not ſay any choſe them: But, <hi>they ſtood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If any did chooſe, probably they were only the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> called <hi>Diſciples</hi> by way of emphatical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The truth is, it was God who made choice.</p>
            <p>If therefore our Brethren could prove, that the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſet theſe two before the Apoſtles, and (as they ſay) in doing that, did as much <hi>as could be done</hi> in the choice of <hi>an extraordinary</hi> Officer; yet this was <hi>juſt nothing;</hi> for nothing was needfull from them in that Caſe.</p>
            <p>Their ſecond Scripture is that, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118929:81"/> where it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>that the twelve called the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Diſciples, and ſaid, Look ye out amongst you ſeven men of honest report,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the former Argument, our Brethren argued thus. <hi>If the Brethren ought to chooſe the greater Officer, then they ought to chooſe the leſs.</hi> Here now they argue quite contrary. <hi>If they ought to chooſe the leſs, then they ought to chooſe the greater;</hi> Surely both theſe Arguments can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold, being both made <hi>affirmatively.</hi> But as to the preſent Argument ſtated thus.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If the Church mentioned, <hi>Act. 6. v. 3, 4. &amp;c.</hi> ought to chooſe Deacons then, a particular Church now ought to chooſe her Pastors.</p>
               <p>But the Church, <hi>Acts 6.</hi> choſe her Deacons. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p n="1">1. We deny the <hi>conſequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We deny the <hi>Aſſumption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will offer Reaſons for both: 1. For the denial of the Conſequence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is plain, that Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. was the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church,</hi> as well as a <hi>particular Church;</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> though a particular man, yet was at that time all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: nor is this <hi>nonſenſe;</hi> for by <hi>univerſal Church,</hi> I mean no more than the whole body of the Goſpel-Church then in the earth, in which were Catholick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, it was furniſhed with twelve Apoſtles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is plain that the perſons chooſing, were ſuch as to the moſt of which the Holy Ghoſt was fallen, and they had <hi>diſcerning Spirits, Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.31. No par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church now can pretend to any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In moſt caſes an Argument will not hold in the affirmative, from the leſſer to the greater, particularly it will not hold in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>That in moſt caſes it will not hold, is evident: none can argue thus; if a man can carry a thouſand weight, much more an hundred thouſand. If my Friend will give me a nights lodging, he will much more give me
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118929:81"/> his houſe and land, or a lodging in his houſe as long as I live.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it is true in ſome caſes it will hold. But not to run into a Logical diſpute; The preſent Queſtion is.</p>
            <q>How far it is lawfull to argue from the leſſer action to the greater as to things to which men have a moral power granted them from another.</q>
            <p>Our Brethren will grant, that the power they plead for on the behalf of the multitude as to the choice of <hi>Church-Officers,</hi> is <hi>moral</hi> not natural, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch a power as they <hi>have from the will of God:</hi> Now as to this I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Nothing can demonſtratively be concluded,</hi> becauſe the <hi>will of another</hi> being the fountain of the power act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth freely, and may make it lawfull to chooſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet unlawfull to chooſe the leſs; as the Law of this Land makes it lawfull for people to chooſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men, and yet not Lawfull for them to chooſe whom they pleaſe for Juſtices of the Peace; and ſo again to <hi>chooſe the leſs, and not the greater;</hi> as the Law makes it Lawfull for people to chooſe a Conſtable of a Pariſh; and yet not lawfull for them to chooſe a <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> of an Army, or a <hi>Juſtice of the Peace;</hi> ſo that no <hi>conſequence of this nature can prove a Law;</hi> but the <hi>Law of God must justifie the Conſequence;</hi> ſo that our Brethren can bring no certain Argument from this Text; the heighth of Argument which our Brethren can pretend to from this Text is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is probable that the Lord, who would not have ſo much as a Deacon choſen without the ſuffrage of the multitude, would not have a Pastor choſen without their ſuffrage.</hi> Our Brethren muſt ſay no more, than it is probable. And then we anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That what ſeemeth probable to ſome from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is not a certain Rule for us to walk by.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:118929:82"/>2. We ſay, it is not probable, becauſe <hi>a Church</hi> is more able to judge of the <hi>abilities of a Deacon, than of a Pastor.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe this Church was more able to judge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
